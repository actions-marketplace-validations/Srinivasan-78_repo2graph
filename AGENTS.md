# Repo rules

## Text slicing — use `split("\n")`, never `splitlines()`

tree-sitter advances `Point.row` on `\n` only. `str.splitlines()` (and universal-newline mode)
*also* break on U+2028, U+2029, U+0085, `\x0b` and `\x0c` — so any source file containing one of
those desyncs Python's line list from the parser's row numbers, and every later symbol's chunk
text gets sliced from the wrong lines. This bug class keeps recurring: ISS-22 (`chunks.py`) and the
`query.py` comment near its `read_jsonl`. The git-log instance this rule used to call "still-open
at `graph.py:380`" is closed — that call is now `split("\n")` with the reason inline — and there
are **no `.splitlines()` calls left anywhere in `repo2graph/`**. Keep it that way; the three
remaining matches for the word are this rule being cited in prose.

- Slice source-against-parser with `src.split("\n")`, dropping a trailing `"\r"` per line for CRLF.
- `chunks.py` already has a `_lines(src)` helper that does exactly this — reuse it.
- `splitlines()` is fine only on content that is guaranteed `\n`-only (e.g. `graph.py:162`
  reading `go.mod`).

## Decoding git subprocess output (Windows / non-UTF-8 locales)

Never pass `text=True` (or `encoding=<locale>`) to a `subprocess` call that reads **git** output.
The Windows locale is cp1252, so a non-ASCII path raises `UnicodeDecodeError` — sometimes inside
the error handler, masking the real failure. Every historical regression in this repo is a
Windows encoding bug (ISS-06/17/22/27); CI now has a `windows-latest` leg specifically to catch
the class.

The established pattern — originated in `walker._git_files`, now also in `graph.add_cochange`
and `fetch.py`:

- run git with `-c core.quotepath=false` so non-ASCII paths return raw, not `"caf\303\251.py"`
  (the quoted form never matches a path/file index, so edges silently vanish);
- capture bytes and `.decode("utf8", "surrogateescape")`;
- always set `timeout=` and convert `TimeoutExpired` into that call's normal error type;
- `fetch.py` may instead use `encoding="utf8", errors="replace"` for user-facing text — same
  intent, no crash on a stray byte.

## Discovery indexes dot-directories, git or not

`walker.discover()` applies one `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` filter to both sources (`git ls-files` and
the `os.walk` fallback) — ISS-13. The `os.walk` path no longer drops every dot-directory, so a
plain-folder build now indexes `.github/**` and any dot-dir not in `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`, matching
what a git checkout always did. Consequence: on non-git builds, tool caches like `.ruff_cache/`,
`.eggs/`, `.cache/` are picked up unless their names are added to `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`
(open follow-up SH-5).

## Two budget models coexist — do not unify them

`Index.retrieve()` and `Index.pack_context()` mean different things by `budget_chars`, on purpose.
`retrieve()` (`query.py:272`) bounds the sum of the returned chunks' `text` only; `pack_context()`
(`query.py:349`) bounds the **whole returned markdown** — map prepend, the `---` separator, every
`### [cite: ...]` header and the blank lines between blocks all charge against it. This reads like
an inconsistency and it is not one: `retrieve()`'s text-only accounting is pinned by
`tests/test_repo2graph.py` (`test_index_retrieves_and_expands`,
`test_iss25_query_constants_and_budget_bounds`) and consumed by `cmd_query`, so "harmonising" the
two silently changes `repo2graph query`'s output for every existing caller.

- New retrieval surface goes on `pack_context()`. `retrieve()` is a back-compat surface: keep its
  positional order `(query, k, hops, budget_chars)` and add only keyword-only params that default
  to today's behaviour (`min_confidence=None` means "no confidence filter", which is what the
  pre-GraphRAG code did).
- `pack_context(budget_chars <= 0)` is unbounded; `retrieve()` has no such convention.

## A new default on a shared traversal helper narrows its existing callers

When you add a filtering parameter to a helper that already has callers, the *safe* default for
the helper is not the safe default for the callers. `expand()` gained
`edge_dirs=None → DEFAULT_EDGE_DIRS` (`query.py:36,245`) — `DEFINES: ("in",)`, `IMPORTS: ("out",)`,
`INHERITS: ("out",)` — which the new packing path wants. `retrieve()` passed no `edge_dirs`, so it
inherited the narrowing and silently lost every DEFINES-out, IMPORTS-in and INHERITS-in neighbour
(41 → 28 neighbours on one probe query; `repo2graph query "how does export write manifest"` dropped
`sym:repo2graph/export.py::_flat`). Same shape as the confidence gate, which *was* neutralised.

- Every pre-existing caller must opt out **by name**, not by omission. `ALL_EDGE_DIRS: dict = {}`
  (`query.py:48`) exists solely so `retrieve()` (`query.py:302-307`) says "no direction filter" in
  the source, where a reader and a `grep` can both see it.
- The confidence gate is `CALLS`-only by design: IMPORTS / DEFINES / INHERITS records carry no
  `confidence` key, and `min_confidence` must never drop them.
- Prove the neutrality against the **baseline**, not against the new code: `git worktree add <tmp>
  <baseline-sha>`, run the same seed list through both trees, compare the tuple lists.

## Tests must pin values, not compare the implementation to itself

`cmd_query`'s output test asserted stdout `== format_pack(Index(out).retrieve(...))`. Both sides
move together under any traversal change, so it stayed green straight through the narrowing bug
above and would stay green through the next one. Same shape in `tests/test_rag.py`'s
`compressed_form` helper, which re-implements `query._compress` and then asserts they agree.

- For retrieval/traversal behaviour, assert literal `(node_id, why)` membership hand-derived from
  the fixture source — never a value computed by the code under test. Set membership only; no
  score, rank, float or ordering (those drift with any scoring tweak).
- Prove a new test is a detector: revert the fix in the working copy, watch the new test fail and
  the old one pass, then restore and confirm `git hash-object` is unchanged.

## A file with little residue emits no file-level chunk

`chunks.py:185` drops a `file_residual` chunk whose body is under 40 characters after every symbol
span is carved out. So a small module that is *all* imports and defs has a node but no chunk — and
a node with no chunk can be neither a seed nor a retrievable neighbour. Consequence for fixtures:
a synthetic package whose modules are pure `def`s physically cannot express an IMPORTS edge through
`retrieve()`, no matter what the traversal does. Give each module a module-level constant/table so
its file node carries a chunk (the `dirs_out` fixture in `tests/test_rag.py` exists only for this;
`rag_repo` hits the threshold and was left alone).

## `layout.path(out, "overview.md")` is `human/overview.md`, not `agent/`

`overview.md` is the one artifact written to two sections — `SECTIONS["overview.md"] = (HUMAN_DIR,
AGENT_DIR)` (`layout.py:45`) — and `layout.rel()` returns the **first**, so `path()` resolves to
`human/`. Everything else agent-facing resolves to `agent/`, which makes the wrong assumption easy.
Readers that must tolerate a deleted overview should treat either copy as optional; use
`layout.paths()` when you need both.

## `rag --answer` uploads repository source to a third-party endpoint

`repo2graph rag --answer` POSTs the assembled pack — real file content out of `chunks.jsonl` — to
whichever provider wins the `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` →
`OLLAMA_HOST` precedence race. Non-source files are chunked whole, so a `.env` in the indexed repo
can be seeded by a query and shipped verbatim. Treat this as the sensitive path:

- It is gated: `answer` is imported lazily and only under `if args.answer:`; a plain `rag` makes no
  DNS lookup and no connect. Keep it that way, and keep the socket-level no-network test.
- `answer._disclose()` prints provider + **hostname only** to stderr before the first byte. Never
  put a credential in a URL (the Gemini key moved to the `x-goog-api-key` header for exactly this
  reason) and never echo `HTTPError.url` in an error message.
- Closed: a `--provider` flag forces a specific provider, and dotfile/secret-ish paths are
  excluded from every `rag`/`query` result -- `--answer` or not -- unless `--include-secrets` is
  passed *at query time* (a build-time `--include-secrets` no longer leaks into later reads).

## Vectors are keyed by chunk id on disk and by list index in memory

`score_rrf(vectors=...)` indexes by the chunk's position in `self.chunks` (`vectors[i] for i in
candidates`), but positions move whenever `chunks.jsonl` is rebuilt. So `vectors.npy` /
`vectors.meta.json` persist `chunk_ids` in row order and `Index.__init__` translates id → current
list index at load. Persisting by row index instead would "work" until the first rebuild that
reorders chunks and then mis-rank silently, forever.

- A missing, truncated or malformed vector pair must leave `self.vectors = None` and raise nothing —
  BM25 is always the floor. Same for ids `chunks.jsonl` no longer contains: they are dropped.
- **Never default the query-side embedding model to `vector_meta["model_id"]`.** `fuse_ok` exists to
  catch a model mismatch; feeding it the index's own model id on both sides makes it a comparison of
  a value with itself — permanently true, unfalsifiable, and the guard is gone. `--embed-model`
  defaults to `embed.DEFAULT_MODEL`, never to what the index happens to claim.
- `embed.py`'s `.npy` reader/writer is stdlib-only **by design**, not for lack of effort. A machine
  that only *queries* a shipped index must not need numpy, or the zero-dependency promise breaks for
  exactly the case vectors were added for. numpy is a fast path when importable, never a requirement.

## Every MCP tool argument is caller-hostile

`repo2graph/mcp.py` hands its output straight into an agent's context window, and the caller picks
the arguments. Bounds go in the **handler**, not in `serve()`, so direct callers, `dispatch()` and
the stdio server all inherit them — this was missed twice in one run (`hops`/`k` first, then
`limit`), each time producing a tool that could return tens of thousands of characters.

- Any new numeric tool argument goes through `_clamp` against an `MCP_MAX_*` constant, in the
  handler, and gets a test that floods the fixture until the ceiling actually binds. A bound asserted
  against a 4-neighbour fixture proves nothing.
- All three handlers pass `exclude_secrets=True` unconditionally. A human running the CLI chose to
  see `.env`; an agent tool returning it is a different class of problem.

## `action.yml`: GitHub expressions and shell disagree about truthiness

GitHub's expression language compares strings **case-insensitively**, so `if: inputs.embed ==
'true'` fires for `"True"` and `"TRUE"`. POSIX `[ "$X" = "true" ]` does not. An input gated in both
places therefore has a casing where the first gate opens and the second stays shut — here that meant
the embed step ran and the rag step then dropped `--vectors`, computing vectors and ignoring them.
The Python suite cannot see this at all.

- Case-fold in the shell (`tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`); the expression language has no
  case-sensitive compare, so tightening the `if:` is not an option.
- `-n` / `-z` non-emptiness tests agree with GitHub for every casing — only `==` equality gates need
  this. `tests/test_compat.py`'s R-6 executes the real `run:` body across casings and fails if a new
  `inputs.X ==` gate appears.

## Discovery order *is* artifact order — keep `discover()` sorted

Node ids are emitted as files are parsed, and edges and chunks follow the nodes. So anything that
perturbs discovery order perturbs `nodes.jsonl`, `edges.jsonl` and `chunks.jsonl` byte-for-byte
while describing an identical graph. `git ls-files` happens to sort; `os.walk` returns filesystem
order — alphabetical on NTFS, hash order on ext4 with `dir_index` — so a non-git build produced
different artifacts on different machines, and **no same-machine A/B could see it** (on NTFS the
unsorted and sorted orders coincide).

- `discover()` sorts both sources in one place, keyed on `Path.as_posix()`. Not `str(Path)`: that
  sorts on `\` on Windows and `/` elsewhere, which is the same divergence one level down.
- A third discovery source must inherit that sort rather than add its own.
- `--max-files N` takes the first N *in discovery order*, so unsorted discovery made two machines
  index different **subsets** of one tree.
- `tests/test_determinism.py` reverses `os.walk` to stand in for "a different filesystem". A test
  that does not do that is not a detector for this class.

## Every edge carries `method`, `confidence` and `evidence` — normalise at the chokepoint

An edge is a claim about the code; without evidence it is an assertion. Four of the six edge types
were once bare `(src, dst, type)` triples, so "why do you think this file imports that one" had no
answer in the artifact.

- `Graph.add_edge` is the single chokepoint and runs `edgemeta.normalize`, so a **new edge type
  cannot ship without the standard fields**. Add per-type metadata at the call site; never bypass
  `add_edge`.
- `confidence` means P(`dst` is the correct target | the relationship at `evidence` exists) — not
  P(the relationship exists). That separation is why an ambiguous name splits 1/n across candidates
  while the call site stays certain, and why `CALLS_EXTERNAL` is 1.0. It **never** encodes dynamic
  dispatch; `call_kind` does.
- `evidence: null` is a real answer for `CONTAINS` and `CO_CHANGE`. Inventing a line for either
  would be a fabricated citation, which is the failure the field exists to prevent.
- Anything added to `ParsedFile` for evidence must round-trip through `parse.cache.json` **and**
  bump `PARSE_CACHE_FORMAT`, or an incremental build emits edges with no evidence where a full
  build emits a line. `import_lines` was caught by the byte-equality tests doing exactly that.
- `docs/reference.md` and `docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md` both describe these records.
  `tests/test_doc_consistency.py` fails if they disagree.
