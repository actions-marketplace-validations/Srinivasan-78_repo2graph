"""Every place this project's own version is written, in one table.

Imported by both `bump_version.py` (which rewrites these) and
`check_version.py` (which verifies them). One table rather than a list in each
script, because two lists drift: the bump knew about five files and the check
knew about three, so the documented surfaces -- the `@vN` tag every Action
consumer is told to use, and the `repo2graph==X.Y.Z` pin examples -- were
bumped by neither. After the 2.0.0 release the README still told users to write
`@v1` and described it as following "every 1.x release", which is a live
instruction to pin to a dead line.

Two kinds of surface:

* `version` -- carries the full `X.Y.Z`.
* `major` -- carries only the major, because it is the *floating* tag
  (`publish.yml`'s "Advance floating major tag" step moves `vN` to each new
  release, so `vN` is a promise about the major and nothing more).

`paths` is an allowlist on purpose, never a glob. `benchmarks/results.json`
records the version that *produced* an artifact -- history, not a claim about
the current release -- and a pattern loose enough to reach it would rewrite
the past. For the same
reason the pin pattern matches `==` only: `docs/cli.md`'s
`repo2graph>=1.4,<2` illustrates the *form* of a range spec and must survive
every bump unchanged.
