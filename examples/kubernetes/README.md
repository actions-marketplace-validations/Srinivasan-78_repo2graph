# Kubernetes graph example

## Repository

[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)

## Revision

Commit `35fc3af13807e70534fb11736bcccc013631efde` on `master`, analyzed 2026-10-06T08:02:24Z
by repo2graph 2.2.0.

Both halves of that line matter. The upstream commit says which *source* produced these
numbers; the repo2graph version says which *analyser* did. Call resolution has changed
across minor versions before — `b98fc46b` stopped binding builtin method calls on untyped
receivers to in-repo methods, which moved `CALLS`, ambiguous-call counts and the
most-called-symbols ranking below — so a figure here is only comparable to a run from the
same version.

## Why this repository?

Kubernetes' full tree is on the order of hundreds of thousands of files once vendor/ and generated clients are counted — not a repository size that a single reproducible CI-friendly run should attempt whole. This is a scoped benchmark (see docs/architecture.md and section "Why this scope" below): the controller-manager entrypoint, the built-in controllers, the scheduler, the pod registry, and the API server's request-handling package (apiserver/pkg/endpoints) — a coherent slice that a "how does a request flow through the API server" or "what calls a specific controller" question can actually be answered against.

## Why this scope

Only the subtrees listed below were cloned and indexed (a **scoped benchmark**, not the whole repository) — see [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md#3-indexing-behaviour).

**Indexed paths:**
- `cmd/kube-controller-manager/**`
- `pkg/controller/**`
- `pkg/scheduler/**`
- `pkg/registry/core/pod/**`
- `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/**`

## Supported languages

- go

## Example queries

These are real `repo2graph query` runs against this index, not invented text — the generator
records each one under `flows/`, which it writes locally and does not commit (see below):

- How does a request flow through the API server?
- Where are controller entry points?
- What calls the pod controller?
- What is the impact radius of changing the scheduler's core interface?

Those files hold each query's real results as citations (node id, path, line range, why it
matched) with the source text stripped out. To run these queries yourself against a live,
queryable index —
i.e. one that still has `chunks.jsonl` and can return actual source text — clone the repository at
the commit above and build it directly:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes /tmp/kubernetes
cd /tmp/kubernetes && git checkout 35fc3af13807e70534fb11736bcccc013631efde
repo2graph build . -o .r2g --include cmd/kube-controller-manager/** pkg/controller/** pkg/scheduler/** pkg/registry/core/pod/** staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/**
repo2graph query "How does a request flow through the API server?" -o .r2g
```

## Generated graph

**Only this page and `overview.md` are committed.** `4e96b628` dropped the rest — about 28 MB of
generated binary and boilerplate that every clone of this repository had to carry — and
`.gitignore` keeps them out, so a regeneration cannot quietly put them back. Everything below is
what the generator writes into this directory when you run it yourself.

- `overview.md` — the prose repo map: languages, most depended-on files, most called symbols
- `nodes.jsonl.gz` / `edges.jsonl.gz` — the graph structure (identifiers, paths, line ranges; no
  source text), gzipped — JSON lines compress 4-9x and there is no reason to commit that redundancy
  raw; `gunzip -k nodes.jsonl.gz` to read it
- `graph.html` — the interactive map (self-contained, opens in any browser, no network needed), capped
  to the 300 best-connected nodes
- `manifest.json` — what every field in the other files means
- `stats.json` — the raw counters above
- `flows/` — citation-only results of the example queries above

`chunks.jsonl` (the retrieval index, which embeds source text per symbol) is discarded by the
generator rather than merely left uncommitted —
see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](../ATTRIBUTIONS.md#why-chunksjsonl-is-not-committed).

## Limitations

Call edges are matched by name, not by type — see
[docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md). Unresolved / ambiguous calls for this example:
13,225 out of 68,185 total CALLS edges.

## Reproduce

```bash
python scripts/generate_examples.py --repo kubernetes
```

This clones `https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes` at `master` (pinned to the commit above only via
`examples/repositories.yaml`; re-running against a moving ref will get a newer commit and
different numbers — see [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md#3-indexing-behaviour)).
