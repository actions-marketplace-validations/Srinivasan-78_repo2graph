## Revision

Commit `e759f6a0d030d83e9340a808993227a6d6bef5cb` on `main`, analyzed 2026-10-06T08:11:29Z
by repo2graph 2.2.0.

Both halves of that line matter. The upstream commit says which *source* produced these
numbers; the repo2graph version says which *analyser* did. Call resolution has changed
across minor versions before — `b98fc46b` stopped binding builtin method calls on untyped
receivers to in-repo methods, which moved `CALLS`, ambiguous-call counts and the
most-called-symbols ranking below — so a figure here is only comparable to a run from the
same version.

## Why this repository?

`extensions/` (bundled extensions, each with its own dependency tree) and `node_modules`-shaped build tooling dominate file count without adding architecturally interesting graph structure. `src/vs/` is the actual editor/workbench/platform source — base services, the editor, the workbench UI, and the Electron/Node entry points — where the "command to handler" and "editor action to service" flows this example set is built around actually live.

## Why this scope

Only the subtrees listed below were cloned and indexed (a **scoped benchmark**, not the whole repository) — see [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md#3-indexing-behaviour).

**Indexed paths:**
- `src/vs/**`

**File cap reached:** the indexed paths above contain more than `max_files: 6000` files; discovery is truncated at that count (deterministic — `git ls-files` order — so re-running gets the same 6000 files for the same commit, not a random sample). This graph is therefore a subset of even the scoped paths, not their complete contents.

## Supported languages

- typescript

## Example queries

These are real `repo2graph query` runs against this index, not invented text — the generator
records each one under `flows/`, which it writes locally and does not commit (see below):

- How does a command reach its handler?
- What is the flow from an editor action to a service?
- What are the core platform services other layers depend on?

Those files hold each query's real results as citations (node id, path, line range, why it
matched) with the source text stripped out. To run these queries yourself against a live,
queryable index —
i.e. one that still has `chunks.jsonl` and can return actual source text — clone the repository at
the commit above and build it directly:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/microsoft/vscode /tmp/vscode
cd /tmp/vscode && git checkout e759f6a0d030d83e9340a808993227a6d6bef5cb
repo2graph build . -o .r2g --include src/vs/**
repo2graph query "How does a command reach its handler?" -o .r2g
```

## Generated graph

**Only this page and `overview.md` are committed.** `4e96b628` dropped the rest — about 28 MB of
generated binary and boilerplate that every clone of this repository had to carry — and
`.gitignore` keeps them out, so a regeneration cannot quietly put them back. Everything below is
what the generator writes into this directory when you run it yourself.

- `overview.md` — the prose repo map: languages, most depended-on files, most called symbols
- `nodes.jsonl.gz` / `edges.jsonl.gz` — the graph structure (identifiers, paths, line ranges; no
  source text), gzipped — JSON lines compress 4-9x and there is no reason to commit that redundancy
  raw; `gunzip -k nodes.jsonl.gz` to read it
- `graph.html` — the interactive map (self-contained, opens in any browser, no network needed), capped
  to the 300 best-connected nodes
- `manifest.json` — what every field in the other files means
- `stats.json` — the raw counters above
- `flows/` — citation-only results of the example queries above

`chunks.jsonl` (the retrieval index, which embeds source text per symbol) is discarded by the
generator rather than merely left uncommitted —
see [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](../ATTRIBUTIONS.md#why-chunksjsonl-is-not-committed).

## Limitations

Call edges are matched by name, not by type — see
[docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md). Unresolved / ambiguous calls for this example:
93,950 out of 459,770 total CALLS edges.

## Reproduce

```bash
python scripts/generate_examples.py --repo vscode
```

This clones `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` at `main` (pinned to the commit above only via
`examples/repositories.yaml`; re-running against a moving ref will get a newer commit and
different numbers — see [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md#3-indexing-behaviour)).
