# Methodology

How the build-scale numbers in [`results.json`](results.json) — file, node and edge counts,
clone and build wall-clock time — were produced, and what would have to match for you to
reproduce them exactly. Retrieval quality is a different benchmark with a different method:
[`real/README.md`](real/README.md).

## What is controlled

- **Repository revision.** Every result is pinned to the exact commit SHA `scripts/generate_examples.py`
  checked out, recorded in both `results.json` and that repository's `examples/<id>/README.md`
  (under "Revision").
  Re-running against the same `ref` (usually `main`/`master`) later will check out a *different*,
  newer commit — see [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md#staleness).
- **repo2graph version.** Recorded per result (`repo2graph_version`, from `repo2graph.__version__`
  at generation time).
- **Scope.** For the four scoped repositories, the exact `include`/`exclude`/`max_files` parameters
  are pinned in `examples/repositories.yaml` — the same repository
  at the same commit with different scope parameters is a different, not-comparable measurement.
- **Analysis parameters.** `git_history` (CO_CHANGE window), `jobs` (parser parallelism, left at the
  default: one process per core), and the format set written (`jsonl,overview,html`) are the same
  for every repository — see `generate_one()` in `scripts/generate_examples.py`.

## What is not controlled, and is not claimed to be

- **Hardware.** These are single-machine numbers (this project's own development machine, Windows,
  Python 3.13.15, whatever else happened to be running at the time) with no isolation, warm-up
  discipline, or repeated-trial averaging. Do not use `build_seconds` here for capacity planning on
  different hardware. There is no hardware-independent alternative in this repository to compare
  against: the controlled synthetic-fixture timings this section used to point at were dropped in
  the documentation consolidation and have not been regenerated.
- **Network conditions.** `clone_seconds` reflects this run's actual bandwidth and GitHub's response
  time at that moment; it is the least reproducible number in the file for exactly that reason.
- **Peak memory.** Not measured, and not claimed anywhere.

## How results.json is updated

`scripts/generate_examples.py` merges new results into the existing file by repository URL (a
re-run of one repository replaces only that repository's entry, keeping the others as they were the
last time they were generated) — see `main()` in that script. This means `results.json` as committed
can hold results from *different generation runs*, potentially days apart, each internally
consistent but not a single synchronized snapshot. Each entry's own `generated_at` timestamp is the
source of truth for when that specific number was measured; do not assume every entry in the file
was produced by the same invocation.

## Reproducing a specific number

1. Find the repository's entry in `results.json` for the exact `commit`, and its scope parameters
   in `examples/repositories.yaml`.
2. `git clone --filter=blob:none <repository url>`, `git checkout <commit>` (and, for a scoped
   repository, `git sparse-checkout set` the same paths from `examples/repositories.yaml`).
3. Time `repo2graph build . -o .r2g --include <same include globs> --max-files <same max_files>
   --git-history <same git_history>` yourself.

A different number under otherwise-identical parameters most likely means different hardware or
network conditions, not a regression. Node and edge counts, unlike the timings, are
deterministic for a given commit and scope — if those differ, it is a real change.
