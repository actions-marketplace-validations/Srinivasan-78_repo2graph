"""PR and diff impact analysis over repo2graph code graphs.

Compares a working branch, commit, or unified diff against a base ref (e.g. main)
to determine:
- What symbols changed (added, modified, deleted)
- Which public APIs may be affected
- Which callers, modules, and tests are impacted
- Which dependency paths cross the changed area
- Which changes look disconnected or suspicious
- Architectural blast radius and risk assessment with grounded evidence

Includes strict guardrails to report uncertainty and avoid claiming definite
runtime breakage when only static graph evidence exists.

#: `--ext-cmd=<cmd>` runs one -- both reachable even though the argv is a list
#: and no shell is involved. That is a leading-character rule, nothing more.
#:
#: An allowlist is the tempting shape here and it is wrong twice over. Refnames
#: legitimately contain `+`, `#`, `=`, `,` and non-ASCII (`feat+1`, `fix#123`,
#: `naïve` are all accepted by `git check-ref-format`), so a character class
#: turns a real branch into "invalid git ref". And *revision expressions* --
#: which is what this actually receives -- add `~ ^ @ { } :` on top, so even
#: `git check-ref-format`'s own character set is too narrow: `HEAD~1`, `HEAD^^`
#: and `main@{u}` are illegal refnames and ordinary diff bases.
#:
#: So: reject empty, reject a leading `-`, and reject the characters git already
#: forbids in a refname and that no revision expression can contain -- ASCII
#: whitespace and control characters (NUL included), plus shell metacharacters
#: that cannot appear in either. A leading `.` goes too, which also disposes of
#: `./x` and `../x`.
#:
#: Note what is deliberately *not* rejected: an interior `..`. `main..dev` is an
#: ordinary two-dot range and a revision a user may reasonably pass as `--base`.
#: It is not a traversal risk, because the revision is passed *before* the `--`
#: in `get_git_diff`, so git resolves it as a revision and never as a path.
