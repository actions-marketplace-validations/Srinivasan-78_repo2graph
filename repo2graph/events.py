"""Structured events on stderr: one JSON object per line, never fatal.

stderr, never stdout. stdout carries either the answer a user is piping into a
file or the MCP server's JSON-RPC stream, and one stray line on either ends the
session. Everything here writes to stderr for that reason alone.

Two rules hold for every function in this module:

* **It cannot raise.** These are diagnostics. A logger that takes down the
  command it was reporting on is worse than no logger, so encoding failures,
  closed pipes and unserialisable payloads all degrade to something printable
  or to silence -- never to a traceback reaching the caller.
* **It cannot emit a partial line.** A SIEM tailing this parses line by line, so
  a record is assembled as one string and written once.

`write_safe` is the single stdout/stderr write path for the whole package. A
redirected Windows stdout is a cp1252 TextIOWrapper, and Git Bash hands a piped
one `errors='surrogateescape'` -- which still raises on any character cp1252
lacks. Both are handled here rather than at each call site.
