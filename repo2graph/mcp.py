"""A stdio MCP server over an existing .r2g index: three tools, one engine.

This is an *additional* surface, not a replacement: every tool is a thin call
into `repo2graph.query.Index`, the same object the CLI and the GitHub Action
use, over the same artifacts. The `mcp` SDK is an optional extra and is
imported only inside serve(), so importing this module costs nothing and the
handlers below are testable without the SDK installed.

Two rules apply to every handler and are not negotiable per call:

* `exclude_secrets=True`, always. The CLI sets it only for `--answer`, but a
  tool an agent can call unattended returning `.env` contents is a different
  class of problem from a human deliberately grepping their own checkout.
* Output is hard-bounded. An agent-facing tool that *can* return 50k tokens
  eventually will, so the caller's budget is clamped and the rendered result
  is re-measured and trimmed rather than trusted.
* Work is hard-bounded too. `k` and `hops` are clamped before they reach the
  engine: serve() awaits every call on one asyncio loop, so a single argument
  that costs minutes wedges the whole server for every client, not just the
  caller that sent it.

The index itself is built on demand. Pointed at a repo with no `.r2g` yet, the
first tool call parses it and writes one, because "add the server, restart, ask
a question, read an error" is an onboarding step users do not complete. That
build is the one unbounded piece of work here and it deliberately blocks the
loop: nothing this server does means anything without an index, so there is no
other call worth serving first. It happens once per process, and once on disk.
