# BM25 ranks a chunk by how much of the question it matches. A *container* chunk
# matches a lot of any question about its contents -- a class docstring is long
# and names everything the class does -- while being, structurally, the one kind
# of chunk that cannot contain the answer: the chunker emits each method as its
# own chunk and cuts them out of the parent, so Flask's `class Flask` chunk
# spans lines 81-1536, costs ~1,150 tokens, and holds not one method body.
#
# Measured on `benchmarks/real/`: container chunks took 54% of pack tokens while
# every evidence definition in the suite was present in some chunk and an oracle
# packer fit 100% of them inside 8,000 tokens. The loss was never retrieval or
# parsing; it was which chunks got the budget.
#
# Penalty rather than exclusion: when the question really is "where is class X
# defined", the container chunk *is* the answer, and at a budget with room to
# spare it should still arrive. 0.15 is deep enough that it never outranks a
# body chunk that matched anything.
CONTAINER_SEED_PENALTY = 0.15

# ...and only once the container is big enough for its presence to cost
# something. The penalty exists because a container crowds bodies out of the
# budget, which a small one does not do: the demo fixture's `app/store.py`
# residual is 91 tokens, names the module that answers "trace a request to
# persistence", and displaces nothing. Flask's `class Flask` is 1,144 tokens
# and displaces four method bodies. Penalising both equally dropped the cheap
# pointer for no budget saved -- caught by `test_demo.py`, not by the
# benchmark, because a 22-question suite does not ask "which file is this in".
