"""Background index builds, so a first tool call need not block for a minute.

The default is still to build synchronously on the first tool call, and that is
a considered position rather than inertia: nothing this server does means
anything without an index, so there is no *other* call worth serving while one
is missing, and a synchronous build that outlives its client still leaves a real
index on disk, so the retry is instant. A failure that heals itself beats one
that does not.

`--async-build` exists for the case that reasoning does not cover: a very large
repository behind a client with a short tool-call timeout, where the synchronous
build is killed and restarted forever because no single call ever completes.
There the caller wants a handle it can poll, which is what this provides.

Progress is an estimate and is labelled as one. `graph.build()` has no progress
callback -- adding one would thread a callable through the parse pool and into
worker processes for a cosmetic number -- so the percentage here is elapsed time
against a rate estimated from the file count. It is deliberately capped below
100 until the build genuinely finishes, because a progress bar that reaches 100
and then keeps going is worse than one that admits it is guessing.
