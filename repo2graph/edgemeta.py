"""The standard metadata every graph edge carries, and what each field means.

An edge is a claim about the code. Before this module, only `CALLS` carried
enough to audit one: `CONTAINS`, `DEFINES`, `IMPORTS` and `INHERITS` were bare
`(src, dst, type)` triples, so "why do you think this file imports that one"
had no answer in the artifact — the reader had to re-derive it by reading the
source and trusting that repo2graph had read it the same way.

Five fields, on every edge, so an answer can be checked instead of believed:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `type` | The relationship: CONTAINS, DEFINES, IMPORTS, CALLS, CALLS_EXTERNAL, INHERITS, CO_CHANGE |
| `evidence` | `{"path", "line"}` — where the relationship is *written*, or None |
| `method` | How it was extracted, so a whole class of edge can be distrusted at once |
| `confidence` | P(`dst` is the correct target), 0..1 |
| `candidate_count` / `ambiguous` | How many targets the name could have meant |

## What `confidence` means, exactly

**The probability that `dst` is the right target, given that the relationship
at `evidence` exists.** It is not a probability that the relationship exists
at all — that is what `evidence` is for, and a syntactic fact read straight
out of a parse tree is not uncertain.

Keeping those two separate is what makes the number usable:

- A `CALLS` resolved to one candidate is `1.0`: the call is there, and there
  was only one thing it could mean.
- A `CALLS` whose name matched 4 candidates is `0.25` each. The call is still
  certainly there; repo2graph just cannot tell which one it reaches.
- A `CALLS_EXTERNAL` is `1.0`. `dst` is a synthetic `external:<name>` node
  meaning "not found in this repository", and that is exactly what was
  determined — the uncertainty is in `call_kind`, not in the target.
- `CONTAINS` and `DEFINES` are `1.0`. A file is in a directory, and a symbol
  is where the parser found it.

What `confidence` never encodes is dynamic dispatch. A `1.0` CALLS edge means
"this name resolves here", not "this line reaches that function at runtime".
`call_kind` carries that (`static` / `possible` / `dynamic` / `decorator`),
and docs/limitations.md carries the rest.

## Reading `method`

`method` names the machinery, so a consumer that distrusts one extraction
path can filter on it rather than on edge type:

- `tree-sitter/<lang>` — read from a parse tree. The `<lang>` matters: the
  same edge type is more reliable from the Python grammar than from the C
  fallback.
- `name-resolver` — the parse tree supplied a *name*, and repo2graph matched
  it to a definition. This is where ambiguity comes from, and it is the only
  method whose confidence is routinely below 1.
- `filesystem` — directory structure. No parsing involved.
- `git-log` — commit history. Correlational, never causal: a CO_CHANGE edge
  says two files changed together, not that either depends on the other.
