"""`human/CHANGELOG.md`: a per-push structural diff of the graph.

Written once per `repo2graph build`, comparing the graph just built against
whatever `agent/nodes.jsonl` / `agent/edges.jsonl` were on disk *before* this
build overwrote them. Human-facing only -- this module is never imported by
`query.py`, `mcp.py` or any other retrieval path, and CHANGELOG.md is not
listed in `chunk_fields`/`FILE_NOTES` as something an agent should read.

Call order from `cli.cmd_build` when `"overview"` is in `--formats` (otherwise
`previous_state` is not called and no CHANGELOG.md is written):

1. `previous_state(outdir)` -- BEFORE `dump_all` runs, while the previous
   build's `agent/nodes.jsonl`/`agent/edges.jsonl` are still the files on disk.
2. `dump_all(...)` overwrites those files with the new build.
3. `write_changelog(outdir, g, prev_state, ...)` -- diffs the in-memory graph
   `g` against the snapshot from step 1.
