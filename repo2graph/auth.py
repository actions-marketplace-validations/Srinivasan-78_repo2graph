"""Bearer-token and OIDC authentication for the HTTP MCP transport.

**This module is for the HTTP transport only.** Authenticating the stdio
transport is not a thing that exists: a stdio server is spawned as a child
process by its client and speaks over an anonymous pipe, so there are no
headers to carry a token and anyone able to write to the pipe already has the
parent process's privileges. The MCP auth specification scopes OAuth 2.0 to
HTTP transports for exactly this reason. `repo2graph-mcp` therefore grew a real
HTTP transport rather than a token check that would have looked like security
without being any.

Everything here is stdlib. RS256 signature verification is the interesting part
of that claim: an RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 verify is `sig**e mod n` followed by a padding
and digest comparison, and Python's integers are arbitrary-precision, so the
whole operation is a `pow()` and a handful of byte comparisons. Pulling in
`pyjwt` and `cryptography` -- two packages, one of them with a compiled
extension -- to avoid sixty lines would have broken the zero-dependency promise
for every user who never turns authentication on.

Security properties this module is responsible for, none of them optional:

* Token comparison is constant time (`hmac.compare_digest`). A `==` on a secret
  leaks its length and prefix to anyone who can time the response.
* Algorithm confusion is refused by an RSA-only `ALGORITHMS` table plus an
  enforced `kty == "RSA"` check. When the JWK declares `alg` (RFC 7517 makes
  that field optional), that value selects the hash and a token claiming a
  different one is refused. When the JWK omits `alg`, the token may choose
  among the RSA entries only -- `{"alg": "none"}` and `{"alg": "HS256"}` still
  miss the table. Adding a non-RSA algorithm to `ALGORITHMS` would reintroduce
  the classic forgery; the table and the `kty` check are the defence, not a
  claim that the token header is ignored.
* A key's declared purpose is honoured. RFC 7517 §4.2/§4.3 make `use` and
  `key_ops` the issuer's own statement of what a key is for, and a JWKS
  routinely publishes encryption keys alongside signing ones. A key marked
  for encryption must never be accepted as a signature verifier.
* `iss`, `aud` and `exp` are all enforced. A signature check alone proves the
  issuer minted *a* token, not that it minted one for this server.
* An unknown `kid` is remembered as a miss for a bounded window, and
  unknown-kid JWKS refetches share a minimum interval independent of `ttl`.
  A stream of tokens carrying random `kid`s therefore cannot amplify
  one-for-one against the issuer. The fetch itself runs outside the cache
  lock so a slow issuer cannot serialise unrelated authentications.
