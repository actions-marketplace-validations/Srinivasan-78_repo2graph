    redirect handler forwards every header except `content-length` and
    `content-type` to the new target, whatever host and whatever scheme it
    names. A provider answering `302 http://somewhere-else` is therefore handed
    the credential, in clear, by a client that had no say in it.

    It would also make `_disclose` untrue. That function prints the provider
    and hostname to stderr before the first byte precisely so the operator
    knows where their repository context is going; a redirect that relocates
    the request makes the printed hostname the one place it did *not* go.

    An http -> https upgrade on the same host is allowed: OLLAMA_HOST is
    legitimately plain http, and moving that to TLS is never the attack.
    Returning None stops urllib with an `HTTPError`, which the caller already
    handles.
