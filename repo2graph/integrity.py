"""Artifact integrity verification, provenance capture, and output path hardening.

Implements:
- Output path safety guards (prevent clobbering root, repo root, source files, symlinks).
- Checksum calculation for generated artifacts.
- Repository provenance capture (commit, branch, tag, dirty status, sanitized origin URL).
- Comprehensive index verification (detecting valid, corrupt, stale, incompatible, partial).
