"""A bundled, self-contained demo repository and the five starter questions.

`repo2graph demo` materialises the fixture below into a scratch directory,
builds a real index over it with the same `build()` / `dump_all()` the `build`
subcommand uses, then answers five questions against it. It is the first-run
path: one command, no repository of your own, no API key, no network.

The fixture is held as source strings rather than shipped as package data on
purpose -- `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` only picks up importable
packages, so a directory of `.py` fixtures would need a `package-data` entry
and would silently vanish from the wheel the first time that entry drifted.
Strings are in the module either way, under `uvx`, `pip`, Docker and a git
checkout alike.

Shape of the fixture, which is what makes all five starter questions
answerable on it: an HTTP route layer calls an auth guard and a service, the
service calls a billing helper and a store, and the store is the only thing
that touches SQL. That is one honest route-to-persistence path, one function
with two callers, one guard enforced in two places, and a test module that
imports the service.
