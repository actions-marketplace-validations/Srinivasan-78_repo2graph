"""`repo2graph bug-report`: a bundle that is useful to a maintainer and safe to post.

The two requirements pull against each other. A maintainer diagnosing "this
edge is wrong" wants the code; a user filing from a private repository cannot
give it. So the rule here is absolute and stated once:

**No file content ever leaves this module.** Not a chunk body, not a line of
source, not a snippet around the edge being reported. Everything in the bundle
is a count, a version, a status, or a name the user explicitly opted into
including.

That makes the bundle weaker than a repro, and it is meant to be: it answers
"what is your environment and what does your index look like" completely,
which is most of the round trips, and it leaves "what does the code say" to
the user's judgement on a case-by-case basis.

## Privacy levels

Paths are the interesting case, because a repo-relative path is not secret in
an open-source project and is competitively sensitive in a private one
(`billing/stripe_migration_v2.py` says a lot). So paths are **off by
default**:

- default -- counts, extensions and languages only. No path, no filename.
- `--include-paths` -- repo-relative paths included. The user is opting in.

Absolute paths are never included at either level: they carry usernames, home
directory layout and employer directory conventions, and they are of no
diagnostic value once the repo-relative path is known.

Never included at any level: environment variable *values*, the git remote
URL, the repository name, author names or emails from git, and anything read
out of a source file.
