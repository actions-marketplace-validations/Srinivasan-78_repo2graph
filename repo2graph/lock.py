        already-unlinked file conflicts with nobody. That gives two ways for
        two builders to both believe they hold this lock:

        * `release()` unlinks the path. A waiter that opened the path just
          before that unlink then locks the now-nameless file successfully,
          while the next process along creates a fresh file at the same path
          and locks that one too.

          has the same effect (which is why the age-based reclaim is gone).

        Since `dump_all`'s directory swap runs under this lock, two holders
        means two concurrent swaps of one index. Comparing the descriptor's
        identity against the path closes the window: a mismatch means we
        locked something that is no longer the lock, so the attempt is
