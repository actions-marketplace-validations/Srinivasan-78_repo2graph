# remaining text before the optional group gives up. Repository content is
# attacker-supplied on every build and `max_file_bytes` defaults to 1.5 MB, so
# a single file of repeated BEGIN lines cost minutes of CPU per build.
#

# literal that follows it, so an unbounded `*` has to backtrack the entire tail
# at every one of the n/11 offsets where `-----BEGIN ` matches. A body of
# repeated *incomplete* headers is therefore quadratic -- measured 1.1 s at
# 107 KB and ~90 s at 1 MB, which `MAX_BODY_BYTES` admits in a single request.
# That is reachable pre-authentication: `http_server._reject` calls `emit()`
# unconditionally, so sanitising a rejected request's own field burns the CPU
# before the 401 is written, and `AuditConfig(level="none")` does not avoid it.
