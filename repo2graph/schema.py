"""Typed shapes for repo2graph's public records: nodes, edges, chunks, retrieval
results, and the two build-time reports (`manifest.json`, `IntegrityReport`).

This module documents a contract; it does not enforce one at runtime. The
functions that actually build these records (`graph.Graph.add_node`,
`graph.Graph.add_edge`, `chunks.iter_chunks`, `export.write_manifest`,
`query.Index.retrieve`/`pack_context`) keep returning plain `dict[str, Any]` —
see the `Record = dict[str, Any]` comment at the top of `query.py` for why that
stays deliberate: a node's dict grows type-specific keys (a `file` node carries
`lang`/`lines`; a `symbol` node carries `kind`/`qualname`/`reach`), and closing
that over a single `TypedDict` would either reject legitimate shapes or make
every field `NotRequired`, which is what `total=False` below already says
without an extra keyword only available on Python 3.11+.

Import from here when you want static checking of code that *consumes*
`nodes.jsonl`/`edges.jsonl`/`chunks.jsonl`/`manifest.json` or the return value
of `Index.retrieve()`/`Index.pack_context()` — annotate your own variables
with these types; nothing in repo2graph itself is retyped to produce them
structurally, so a mismatch here is a documentation bug, not a runtime one.
`tests/test_schema.py` is the drift detector: it builds a real index and
checks every field this module declares required actually appears on a real
record, so a field renamed in `chunks.py`/`export.py` without a matching edit
here fails CI.

Every name below is public API, imported as `from repo2graph.schema import
ChunkRecord, ...` (this module is not re-exported from the package root, so
`repo2graph.schema` is the one import path). Anything named with a leading
underscore anywhere else in the package (`query._compress`,
`query._is_secret_path`, `export._stats_extra`, ...) is internal: it may
change shape or disappear between releases without that counting as a
breaking change to the public API described here and in `docs/python-api.md`.
