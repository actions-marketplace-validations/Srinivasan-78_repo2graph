# Issue triage and labels

How an issue gets classified here, what each label means, and what has to be true before an issue
is workable.

---

## 1. What makes an issue workable

An issue is ready when a contributor who has never seen the codebase can start on it without
asking a question first. Concretely, three things:

1. **The code.** `path/to/file.py:line`, with the relevant lines quoted. "The parser mishandles X"
   is a lead; `parse.py:_callee_name` splits on `("::", ".", "->")` and PHP uses `\` is an issue.
2. **The trigger.** A command, an input or a failing test. For a missing capability rather than a
   defect: the call you wanted to make and what happens instead.
3. **One acceptance criterion that can be false.** "Audit every `except Exception`" cannot be
   checked; "no bare `except Exception` remains in `repo2graph/mcp.py`, and `ruff` enforces it"
   can.

A fourth, specific to this repository:

4. **Check it against [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) first.** Several documented invariants look like
   bugs and are not. The two budget models in `query.py` are deliberately different and must not be
   unified; `splitlines()` is banned in favour of `split("\n")` for a reason that recurs; the
   40-character `file_residual` threshold in `chunks.py:185` is intended; call resolution is
   name-based on purpose. An issue proposing to change one of these needs to argue against the
   recorded reason, not merely notice the behaviour.

Issues that assert a defect without (1) get `needs-reproduction`. That is not a rejection — it
names the next step, which is establishing whether the problem is real.

## 2. Triage buckets

Every open issue belongs to exactly one **type** bucket.

| Bucket | Label | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Bug | `bug` | Behaviour contradicts documented or obviously-intended behaviour, **with evidence**. |
| Enhancement | `enhancement` | New capability or a deliberate change to existing behaviour. |
| Documentation | `documentation` | The code is right and the docs are wrong, missing or misleading. |
| Chore / CI / refactor | `type/chore`, `type/ci`, `type/refactor` | No user-visible behaviour change. |
| Question | `question` | A request for information. Usually belongs in Discussions → Q&A instead. |
| Duplicate | `duplicate` | The same work as another open issue. The *older or better-specified* one survives. |
| Superseded | `superseded` | Replaced by a differently-framed issue, not strictly a duplicate. |
| Needs reproduction | `needs-reproduction` | Asserts a defect without naming the code that exhibits it. |
| Out of scope | `out-of-scope` | Deliberately not doing it. The reply must say **why**, and what to do instead. |
| Epic | `type/epic` | A tracking issue. Children carry the real type labels; the epic carries none. |

Orthogonal overlays, any number of which may apply:

| Label | Means |
|---|---|
| `good first issue` | Small, self-contained, has a code pointer and a testable outcome. See §3. |
| `help wanted` | The maintainer is not going to get to this; a contributor would be welcome. |
| `security` | Security-relevant defect or hardening. **Not** for undisclosed vulnerabilities — those go through [the advisory flow](../.github/SECURITY.md). |
| `performance` | Measurable speed or memory effect. |
| `backlog` | Deferred by a recorded audit, with the route back written down. |
| `needs-decision` | Blocked on a maintainer call, not on work. |
| `area/*` | Which part of the codebase. One per issue where possible. |
| `priority/P1..P3` | P1 correctness or security; P2 meaningful; P3 nice to have. |

### Rules that make the taxonomy mean something

- **`bug` and `enhancement` are mutually exclusive.** If it is both, it is two issues.
- **One priority scale.** `priority/P1..P3` only. (`priority/high` is the retired duplicate — §4.)
- **One type label.** Four type labels on one issue means the issue has not been triaged.
- **An epic carries no type label.** Its children carry them.
- **`question` is rarely right.** If someone is asking how something works, that is Discussions →
  Q&A; if the docs failed to answer it, that is `documentation`.

## 3. What qualifies as `good first issue`

All five, not three of five:

1. **A code pointer in the issue** — file and line, not "somewhere in the parser".
2. **Bounded blast radius** — one or two files. Nothing that changes an artifact format, a public
   signature or a documented invariant.
3. **A testable outcome** — you can say in advance which test will be added and what it asserts.
4. **No unresolved design decision.** If the first task is choosing between two approaches, it is
   not a first issue.
5. **It does not need the whole pipeline in your head.** Changing `TOKEN_RE` qualifies; changing
   how chunks are cut does not, because chunk boundaries interact with citation offsets.

Current starter tasks with full acceptance criteria and code pointers:
**[docs/good-first-issues.md](good-first-issues.md)**.

## 4. Proposed label taxonomy

The repository has **61 labels** with four duplicated axes. Nothing below has been applied yet.

### 4.1 To create

| Label | Colour | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `needs-reproduction` | `#d876e3` | Asserts a defect without naming the code that exhibits it |
| `out-of-scope` | `#ffffff` | Deliberately not doing this; see the issue reply for why |
| `needs-decision` | `#fbca04` | Blocked on a maintainer decision, not on work |
| `superseded` | `#cfd3d7` | Replaced by a better-specified issue |
| `type/epic` | `#5319e7` | Tracking issue; children carry the real type labels |

### 4.2 To retire, after migrating the issues that carry them

Each of these duplicates an axis that already has a canonical label. Deleting a label removes it
from every issue irreversibly, so this is the last step, not the first.

| Retire | Keep | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `fix`, `type/fix` | `bug` | Three labels for one concept. `bug` is GitHub's default and what search suggests. |
| `feat`, `type/feat` | `enhancement` | Same. |
| `docs`, `type/docs` | `documentation` | Same. `area/docs` stays — it is the *area*, not the type. |
| `chore` | `type/chore` | Keep the namespaced one; `type/*` is the convention for the rest. |
| `test` | `type/test` | Same. `area/tests` stays. |
| `priority/high` | `priority/P1` | Two parallel priority scales. 12 issues carry both. |
| `invalid` | `needs-reproduction` / `out-of-scope` | "This doesn't seem right" says nothing actionable. |
| `wontfix` | `out-of-scope` | Same meaning, clearer name, and it reads less like a dismissal. |

That is 61 → 51, with every remaining label on exactly one axis: **type**, **area**, **priority**,
**state**, or **PR metadata** (`size/*`, `needs-rebase`, `has-conflicts`, and the rest, which
`prod-igy` applies to pull requests and which no issue should carry).

### 4.3 The axes, after consolidation

| Axis | Labels | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Type | `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `type/chore`, `type/ci`, `type/refactor`, `type/test`, `type/epic`, `question` | Exactly one |
| Area | `area/cli`, `area/docs`, `area/embed`, `area/graph`, `area/mcp`, `area/query`, `area/tests`, `area/walker`, `area/workflows`, `area/action` | One, ideally |
| Priority | `priority/P1`, `priority/P2`, `priority/P3` | Exactly one |
| State | `needs-reproduction`, `needs-decision`, `duplicate`, `superseded`, `out-of-scope`, `backlog`, `help wanted`, `good first issue` | Any number |
| Flags | `security`, `performance`, `accessibility` | Any number |

## 5. Closing an issue

- **Never close an issue without a reply that says why.** A closed issue with no comment is
  indistinguishable from an abandoned one, and it is the fastest way to lose a contributor.
- **Duplicates keep the better-specified issue, not the older one.** Copy anything the closing
  issue said that the survivor does not, then link both ways.
- **Out of scope needs an alternative.** "We are not doing X" should be followed by "because Y,
  and the thing that would make X easy for someone else is Z."
- **Stale is not a reason.** This project has no stale bot and should not get one. An issue that
  has gone quiet is either still true or was never reproducible; decide which.

it does to pull requests.
