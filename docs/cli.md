# CLI reference

Every flag `repo2graph` takes, and what it actually counts. See the
[README](../README.md) for the five-minute version, or
[docs/quickstart.md](quickstart.md) for the two-minute one.

Run `repo2graph` with no arguments and it prints help and exits 0. Ctrl-C stops
with exit code 130 instead of a traceback, closing a pipe early (`| head`) is not
an error, and an index that is missing, half-written or corrupt gets a sentence
naming the rebuild command that fixes it. All numeric flags reject negatives.

## `demo` — the first command to run

```bash
repo2graph demo [-o DIR] [--keep] [--full]
```

Writes a small bundled repository (an orders service: routes → auth guard →
rules → SQL store, plus a test module and a JS client) to a scratch
directory, builds a real index over it with the same code path `build` uses,
and answers the five starter questions against it. Nothing is downloaded, no
LLM is called, and no repository of your own is needed.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-o`, `--out DIR` | a temp directory | write the demo repo here and keep it |
| `--keep` | off | keep the temp repo and its index instead of deleting them |
| `--full` | off | print every answer in full, not the first cited block |

The fixture is held as source strings inside `repo2graph/demo.py`, not as
package data, so it is present under `uvx`, `pip`, Docker and a git checkout
alike. With no `-o` the repository is materialised into a temp directory and
removed on the way out; `--out` and `--keep` both leave it in place so you
can run further commands against `<dir>/.r2g`.

Each answer prints its citation table — `path:start-end`, the symbol, and
*why* the block is in the pack (`seed`, or the edge that reached it) —
followed by the head of the first cited block. The five questions themselves
are listed in [the quickstart](quickstart.md#the-five-starter-questions).

## `build` — make the map

```bash
repo2graph build /path/to/project -o .r2g --git-history 200
```

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-o`, `--out` | `.r2g` | Where the map is written. |
| `--formats` | `jsonl,graphml,cypher,overview,html` | Which artifacts to write. Drop what you do not need to save time. |
| `--include` | none | Glob(s) to keep, e.g. `'**/*.py'`. |
| `--exclude` | none | Glob(s) to skip, e.g. `'**/test/**'`. |
| `--parse-policy` | `best-effort` | AST error handling policy: `best-effort` (log and continue), `warn` (emit stderr warnings), `strict` (fail build on syntax error). |
| `--git-history` | `0` | Commits to read for `CO_CHANGE` arrows. Capped at 5000. |
| `--cochange-min` | `3` | Minimum co-edits across git history required to emit a `CO_CHANGE` edge. |
| `--max-files` | `0` (all) | Stop after N files, for very large projects. |
| `--jobs` | `0` (auto) | Parallel workers. Auto means one per core, up to 8. |
| `--viz-nodes` | `300` | Node cap in `graph.html`. `0` draws an empty graph; `all` draws every node. |
| `--no-chunks` | off | Skip the retrieval chunks entirely. |
| `--max-call-candidates` | `5` | When a call's name matches several symbols and none can be picked by scope, it fans out to at most this many `CALLS` edges, each at confidence 1/n (n = the edges kept); further candidates get no edge. Minimum 1. Recorded as `max_call_candidates` in `manifest.json`. |
| `--max-nodes` | `0` (unbounded) | Fail the build with `GraphLimitExceeded` once the graph holds more than this many nodes — a guard for CI or shared machines against an unexpectedly huge tree. |
| `--max-file-mb` | `1.5` | Files larger than this are skipped (or chunked). Minimum is 0.1 MB. |
| `--include-vendor` | off | Index files inside `vendor/` directories (skipped by default). |
| `--exclude-dir` | none | Additional directory name to skip. Repeatable (e.g. `--exclude-dir generated --exclude-dir tmp`). |
| `--exclude-group` | none | Exclude a named group of paths: `generated`, `vendor`, `build`, `dependencies`, `sensitive`, or `all`. Repeatable, composable with `--exclude`. `--exclude-group help` prints what each covers and builds nothing. See **[docs/INDEXING.md](INDEXING.md#controlling-what-gets-indexed)**. |
| `--chunk-large-files` | off | Instead of skipping, split files larger than `--max-file-mb` into parseable chunks. |
| `--incremental` | off | Reuse parse results for files whose content hash is unchanged. |
| `--include-secrets` | off | Explicitly opt in to indexing secret/credential files (excluded by default). |
| `--secret-policy` | `redact-match` | Inline content secret handling: `redact-match` (default, line-preserving), `exclude-file`, `warn-only`, `off`. |
| `--secret-keyword` | none | Custom substring keyword for secret file matching (repeatable). |
| `--secret-dir` | none | Custom directory name for secret directory matching (repeatable). |
| `--allow-symlink-out` | off | Allow `-o` to point through a symbolic link. Off by default to prevent accidental writes outside the repo tree. |
| `--force` | off | Allow overwriting an existing directory that was not created by repo2graph. Without this flag, build refuses to write into any non-empty directory that does not contain a recognised index. |
| `--lock-timeout` | `60` | Seconds to wait for the per-output-directory build lock before failing. Increase this when several CI jobs share the same network-mounted output path. |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Include vendor directories and parse huge files in chunks (useful for monorepos)
repo2graph build /path/to/project --include-vendor --chunk-large-files

# Skip 'generated' and 'tmp' directories, and adjust file limit to 5 MB
repo2graph build /path/to/project --exclude-dir generated --exclude-dir tmp --max-file-mb 5.0
```

Artifacts are staged in a sibling temp directory and atomically swapped into
`--out` on success, so a crash or a full disk never leaves a half-written index
behind. The previous build is restored on failure. Files written by subsequent
commands (`embed`, `github`) are preserved across rebuilds.

### `--incremental`

Every build writes `agent/parse.cache.json`: each file's sha256 alongside the
symbols and imports parsed out of it. With `--incremental`, the next build into
the same `--out` re-reads every file but only *re-parses* the ones whose hash or
language changed. Parsing is what dominates a build, so on a repo where a handful
of files moved this is close to free.

The result is byte-for-byte identical to a full rebuild, and that is a property
of the design rather than a hope. A file's symbol table depends on its own bytes
and its language and nothing else, so reusing one is exact. Everything that is
*not* per-file — the repo-global name index, `CALLS` confidences, `INHERITS`
edges, entrypoint flags and reach counts — is recomputed from the complete symbol
set on every build, incremental or not. Nothing is spliced, so nothing goes
stale. `tests/test_incremental.py` asserts the byte equality directly across an
added file, a modified file, a deleted file and a no-op.

The build report gains an `incremental` block when the flag is on:

```json
{ "incremental": { "cached": 812, "reparsed": 3 } }
```

**When a full rebuild is still required.** The cache is keyed on file content, so
it cannot see a change in how content is *interpreted*. Rerun without the flag
after upgrading repo2graph, after a `tree-sitter-language-pack` upgrade that
changes a grammar, or if you ever suspect the cache. Doing so costs only time —
a full build overwrites the cache and puts you back on a known-good footing.
Cache entries written by a different cache format are ignored automatically, as
is a cache that is missing, unreadable or corrupt; each of those degrades to a
full build rather than to a wrong one.

## `github` — map a project you do not have locally

```bash
repo2graph github psf/requests -o out/requests --git-history 200
```

Downloads to a temp directory, builds the map, tidies up, and writes an extra
`agent/index.json` recording exactly which project and which commit it read. `gh`
is an alias, and full web URLs work. Takes every `build` flag, plus:

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--ref` | default branch | Branch or tag to read. |
| `--depth` | `0` (full) | Shallow-clone depth. |
| `--keep-clone` | temp dir | Clone here and keep it instead. |
| `--token` | `$GH_TOKEN` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN` | Token for a private project. |

## `query` — fast local search

```bash
repo2graph query "how does routing match a path" -o .r2g -k 8 --hops 1
repo2graph query "auth middleware" -o .r2g --format json | jq '.[].path'
```

Finds the best matching pieces, then follows the arrows one step out so the
functions around each answer come along too.

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-o`, `--out` | `.r2g` | Index folder to read. |
| `-k` | `8` | Pieces the text search starts with. |
| `--hops` | `1` | Steps to walk along the arrows. |
| `--budget` | `24000` | Character budget for the **chunk text only**. |
| `--min-conf`, `--min-confidence` | off | Drop `CALLS` arrows below this confidence. |
| `--format` | `text` | `text` or `json`. `--json` is the old spelling of `--format json`. |
| `--include-secrets` | off | Include secret-looking files (`.env`, keys, credentials) in the results. Off by default **even if the index was built with `--include-secrets`** — see [Secrets at query time](#secrets-at-query-time). |
| `--exclude-secrets` | — | Deprecated no-op kept for old scripts; exclusion is the default. |
| `--vectors` / `--no-vectors` | off | `--vectors` fuses the index's dense vectors into the ranking (an error if they are missing or the model does not match); `--no-vectors` forces word matching only. Same meaning as on `rag`. |
| `--embed-model` | the `embed` default | Model used to embed the query for `--vectors`; must match the index. |

## `rag` — pack cited context for an LLM

```bash
repo2graph rag "how does the context pack stay inside its budget" -o .r2g
```

Picks the best matching pieces, follows the arrows out to their neighbours, puts
the repo map on top, and stamps every block with an exact citation header:

```
# Repo map: repo2graph

files: 41  nodes: 644  edges: 2160
languages: python=15, yml=11, md=7, json=2, toml=2, txt=1

## Most depended-on files
- repo2graph/export.py (in=6)
- repo2graph/parse.py (in=6)
...

---

### [cite: repo2graph/cli.py:22-28] `parse_formats` (CALLS out of cmd_build)
# file: repo2graph/cli.py
# function: parse_formats  (lines 22-28, python)
# called by: repo2graph/cli.py::cmd_build, repo2graph/cli.py::cmd_github
# calls (outside the repo): strip, split, sorted, set, SystemExit, join
def parse_formats(spec: str) -> set[str]:
...
```

The `(CALLS out of cmd_build)` part is the *reason* the block is in the pack:
either `seed` (the search found it) or the arrow that dragged it in.

The first argument is optional. Give it an index folder, a source folder to index
on the spot, or a GitHub project, and it works out which you meant:

```bash
repo2graph rag . "where does the CLI parse arguments"       # index this folder first
repo2graph rag psf/requests "how are redirects followed"    # download, index, ask
```

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-o`, `--out` | `.r2g` | Index folder to read, or to write when a target has to be indexed first. |
| `-k` | `8` | Pieces the text search starts with. |
| `--hops` | `1` | Steps to walk along the arrows. |
| `--budget` | `24000` | Character budget for the **whole** pack. `0` means no budget. |
| `--budget-tokens` | unset | Token budget for the **whole** pack. When given it replaces `--budget` as the unit. |
| `--min-conf`, `--min-confidence` | `1.0` | Drop `CALLS` arrows the parser was less than this sure about. |
| `--vectors` / `--no-vectors` | off | `--vectors` adds meaning-based search on top of the word matching. An error if the index has no vectors, the `rag` extra is missing, or the model does not match. Off unless you ask: turning it on loads a model and downloads ~90 MB the first time. An index that happens to carry vectors is not permission to go and fetch one. |
| `--embed-model` | the `embed` default | Which sentence-transformers model embeds your question for `--vectors`. Must match the one the index was built with. Not `--model`. |
| `--no-expand` | off | Text search only, no arrow walking. |
| `--format` | `markdown` | `markdown` for the pack, `json` for the pack plus its parts. |
| `--answer` | off | Send the pack to an LLM and stream the answer. [See the warning](#answer-sends-your-code-elsewhere). |
| `--model` | provider default | Override the best-effort default model, only with `--answer`. |
| `--provider` | auto | `gemini`, `openai`, `anthropic` or `ollama`, only with `--answer`. |
| `--include-secrets` | off | Include secret-looking files in the pack (and, for a source-folder target, index them). See below. |
| `--exclude-secrets` | — | Deprecated no-op kept for old scripts; exclusion is the default. |

`--format json` gives you `markdown` plus `chunks`, `seeds`, `neighbors`,
`truncated`, `budget_chars`, `used_chars`, `tokens_budget`, `tokens_used` and
`query`, so a program can see what got left out (a compressed neighbour is
described under the examples below):

```bash
repo2graph rag "how does export write the manifest" -o .r2g --format json \
  | jq '{used: .used_chars, budget: .budget_chars, cut: .truncated}'
```

A neighbour that did not fit whole is **compressed** to its header and first
line. Its cite then names the lines it shows, not the whole symbol or file —
``### [cite: pkg/mod.py:12-12] `Foo.bar` [excerpt of 12-40] (CALLS out of run)``
— and its `chunks` record carries `excerpt_of: [12, 40]` with `start_line` /
`end_line` narrowed to match. Where the shown line cannot be mapped back to a
source line (a file's residual, or a later part of a split chunk) the range is
kept and marked `[header and first line only, of 1-648]` instead.

### Secrets at query time

`query` and `rag` leave secret-looking files — dotenv files, `.pem`/`.key`,
keystores, credential stores — out of what they return unless you pass
`--include-secrets` **on that command**. The build-time flag decides what goes
*into* the index; it does not decide what every later reader gets back, so an
index built with `build --include-secrets` still answers a plain `rag` or
`query` without them. (Previously a plain `rag` only excluded them with
`--answer`; `--exclude-secrets` is now a deprecated no-op that prints a warning.)

## `embed` — meaning-based search on top of the words

Word matching misses a piece of code that says the same thing in different words.
`embed` turns every chunk into a vector once, writes it next to the index, and
`query`/`rag` blend the two rankings from then on.

```bash
pip install "repo2graph[rag]"     # sentence-transformers + numpy, optional
repo2graph embed -o .r2g          # writes agent/vectors.npy + vectors.meta.json
repo2graph rag "how is a request routed" -o .r2g --vectors
```

| Flag | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-o`, `--out` | `.r2g` | Index folder to embed. |
| `--model`, `--embed-model` | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Which model to use. Two spellings for one flag; the Action uses the long one. |
| `--batch` | `64` | Texts handed to the model per call. |
| `--force` | off | Re-embed everything instead of reusing unchanged chunks' vectors. |
| `--verify-rag` | off | Check the index's vectors, model, dimensions, and chunk coverage to verify that dense retrieval can engage. Reports failures and exits non-zero if the dense path is broken. `rag_extra_installed` is always `true`/`false`, even for an index with no vectors. |

Three things worth knowing:

- **Re-running it is cheap.** A chunk's vector is reused unless the chunk's own
  text changed, so a rebuild after editing one file re-embeds one file's chunks.
  The report says how many: `{"vectors": 412, "reused": 408, "embedded": 4, ...}`.
- **Reading the vectors needs nothing.** `vectors.npy` is a plain NumPy file, but
  repo2graph reads it with the standard library alone. A machine that only
  *queries* a shipped index does not need the `rag` extra — only the machine that
  *creates* the vectors does.
- **A model mismatch is refused, not papered over.** The model name and vector
  width are stored beside the vectors. `--vectors` stops with an error naming both
  sides rather than fusing two models' geometry into a plausible-looking wrong
  ranking. If you embedded with something else, say so on the query side too:
  `repo2graph rag "..." --vectors --embed-model BAAI/bge-small-en`.

## `map` and `stats`

```bash
repo2graph map -o .r2g --viz-nodes 80    # redraw graph.html with fewer dots
repo2graph stats -o .r2g                 # raw stats.json, verbatim (default)
repo2graph stats -o .r2g --format text   # human-readable quality summary
```

`stats` prints `agent/stats.json` verbatim by default — that has always been the
default, and `--json` is just an explicit way to ask for it. Pass `--format text`
for a formatted summary of the same counts, covering:
- **Calls resolution breakdown**: `calls_scoped` (resolved within class/file/imports), `calls_unique_global`, `calls_ambiguous`, `calls_untyped_receiver` (the subset of ambiguous calls that are builtin method names on an untyped receiver), and `calls_external`.
- **Inheritance metrics**: `unresolved_bases` counting base classes that could not be mapped to an indexed class node.
- **Import resolution**: `imports_resolved` vs `imports_unresolved`.
- **Parsing health**: total files, symbols, chunks, and any `parse_errors` encountered.

## The two `--budget` flags count different things

This surprises people, so it is worth saying plainly. Both commands take
`--budget`, and each means what its own job needs:

- **`query --budget`** bounds the code itself: the sum of the `text` of the pieces
  it hands back. Headers and formatting are not charged.
- **`rag --budget`** bounds the finished markdown: the map on top, the `---`
  separator, every `### [cite: ...]` header and the blank lines between blocks all
  come out of the same budget.

So the same number gives you less code from `rag` than from `query`. That is on
purpose: `query`'s accounting is what it has always done and programs depend on
it, while `rag` has to promise an LLM that the thing it is handed fits.

## How retrieval works

1. **Text search first.** BM25, the standard word-matching score, with one twist:
   if a word in your question is exactly the name of a function or class, that
   piece's score is multiplied. Asking about `parse_formats` finds
   `parse_formats`, not the prose that happens to mention it.
2. **Optional fusion.** Run `repo2graph embed` (or bring your own vectors) and
   `Index.score_rrf()` blends the two rankings with reciprocal rank fusion. No
   extra library is needed to *read* the vectors, and with no vectors it is
   exactly plain BM25.
3. **Then the arrows, by direction.** Expansion is not "everything one step
   away". It follows `CALLS` both ways (what this calls, and what calls it),
   `DEFINES` inwards (the file or function that holds this one), `INHERITS`
   outwards (the base classes) and `IMPORTS` outwards (the modules it borrows
   from).
4. **Then the budget.** Blocks are added best-first until the budget is used up.

## ⚠️ `--answer` sends your code to someone else's computer

`repo2graph rag --answer` is the one command in this project that touches the
network with your source in it. Read this before you use it.

```bash
repo2graph rag "how does session auth work?" -o .r2g --answer --provider openai
```

It POSTs the assembled pack — **real file content from your repository** — to an
LLM provider over HTTPS, and streams the grounded answer back to stdout.

- **It is opt-in and nothing else does it.** The provider code is only imported
  when `--answer` is present. A plain `rag`, a `query` or a `build` makes no DNS
  lookup and opens no socket.
- **It tells you before it sends.** Before the first byte leaves, it prints the
  provider name, the hostname and how many characters are going, to stderr:

  ```
  repo2graph: sending 18423 chars of repository context to provider openai at api.openai.com (selected by OPENAI_API_KEY)
  ```

- **Secret-ish files are dropped from the pack** (with or without `--answer`, unless you pass `--include-secrets`). Dotfiles,
  `.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, keystores and friends are excluded. This is a guard, not
  a guarantee: a secret pasted into an ordinary `.py` file is still ordinary
  source and still goes.
- **Pick the provider deliberately.** With no `--provider`, the first of
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_HOST` that is
  set wins. If several are set you may not be sending where you think.
  `--provider ollama` with `OLLAMA_HOST` pointed at your own machine keeps
  everything local.
- **Zero SDKs.** All four providers are spoken to with the standard library's
  `urllib`. Nothing extra to install, and nothing extra with an opinion about your
  credentials.

Default models are best-effort cheap/fast ids (`gemini-3.6-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`,
`claude-haiku-4-5` and `llama3.1`); pass `--model` to override.

## `index-status` — is this index current, and what is in it?

```bash
repo2graph index-status [-o DIR] [-r REPO] [--json] [--check]
```

Joins `manifest.json`, `stats.json` and the working tree into one report:
the indexed commit and branch, when the index was built, file/symbol/edge
counts, detected languages, what discovery skipped and why, parse failures,
the index's size on disk, and whether the tree has moved since the build.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-o`, `--out DIR` | `.r2g` | The index directory |
| `-r`, `--repo PATH` | the index's parent | The source tree, when the index lives elsewhere |
| `--json` | off | The full report as JSON; every key is public |
| `--check` | off | Exit `1` when freshness is not `current` |

`--check` turns "the committed index matches this commit" into a CI gate:

```yaml
- run: repo2graph index-status -o .r2g --check
```

Freshness is `current`, `stale`, or `unknown` — the last meaning nothing
could be checked (no `index.state.json`, not a git checkout, or past the
50,000-file scan bound), which is deliberately not reported as staleness.

Related: `stats` reports retrieval *quality* (call-resolution tiers,
unresolved imports); `doctor` reports whether anything is *broken*. Full
detail, including the determinism guarantees: **[docs/INDEXING.md](INDEXING.md)**.

## `bug-report` — a bundle that is safe to paste into a public issue

```bash
repo2graph bug-report [-o DIR] [-r REPO] [--category CAT] [--include-paths] [--json] [--write FILE]
```

Assembles environment and versions, the non-passing `doctor` checks, the
index's shape and freshness, and an edge-quality histogram (counts by type, by
extraction method, and by confidence bucket) — which is often what explains a
bad answer, since a graph dominated by ambiguous name matches behaves
differently from one that resolves cleanly.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--category CAT` | One of `incorrect-relationship`, `missing-relationship`, `stale-index`, `parser-failure`, `answer-unhelpful`. Adds a checklist of the extra evidence that category needs. |
| `--include-paths` | Include repo-relative file paths (off by default) |
| `--json` | The raw bundle instead of the markdown |
| `--write FILE` | Write to a file instead of stdout |

**No file content is included, at any setting** — not a chunk body, not a line
of source. Nor are environment variable values, the git remote URL, the
repository or branch name, or absolute paths. File paths are off by default
(a path like `billing/stripe_migration_v2.py` says a lot about a private
repository); changed files appear as 8-character fingerprints so a maintainer
can tell two entries apart without learning what they are.

The commit sha *is* included: it makes a wrong edge reproducible against a
public repo and reveals nothing a private repo's own history does not.

Full contents and the reasoning: **[docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md](OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md#feedback-and-the-bug-report-bundle)**.

## `doctor` — diagnose the environment and artifacts

```bash
repo2graph doctor [path] [--json]
```

Inspects the runtime environment, the index and the MCP client wiring for the
problems that actually stop a first run. `[path]` may be either a repository
or an index directory; the checks that need both work either way.

**Environment**

- **Python version**: checks that Python is >= 3.10.
- **Package version**: warns when the imported module and the installed
  dist-info disagree — a shadowed editable install, or a stale dist-info from
  a partial upgrade.
- **uv / pip availability**: reports `uv`/`uvx` and `pip`. Absent uv is *not*
  an error — only the `uvx repo2graph ...` one-liner needs it — but neither
  uv nor pip is, since nothing can then install the `[mcp]` or `[rag]` extras
  the other checks recommend.
- **Tree-sitter & grammars**: checks that `tree-sitter` and
  `tree-sitter-language-pack` are installed and loads every supported grammar.
- **Git integration**: verifies `git` availability and non-ASCII path support.
- **Directory permissions**: verifies write permissions in the target directory.
- **Platform encoding**: checks console and filesystem encoding to detect
  potential charmap limitations.

**The index**

- **Artifact integrity**: validates `manifest.json`, `chunks.jsonl`,
  `nodes.jsonl` and `edges.jsonl` if an index exists.
- **Index freshness**: does the index still describe the tree it was built
  from? Three signals, cheapest first — the commit recorded in the manifest
  against the tree's current `HEAD`; the discovered file set against
  `index.state.json`; and a real sha256 for any file whose mtime is newer
  than the manifest's. The mtime only chooses *what* to hash, so a checkout
  that rewrites every mtime without changing a byte does not report stale.
- **Parser coverage**: parse errors and files with no grammar *in this
  index*. Distinct from the grammar check above: a grammar that loads fine
  still yields a symbol-free file node when the source uses syntax it does
  not model, and that file is then reachable by text but carries no CALLS
  edges.
- **Ignored paths**: discovery mode (`git ls-files` vs `os.walk`) and what
  each skip rule excluded. Warns when more than two thirds of the candidate
  files were skipped, which is the signature of a repository whose source
  lives under a name in `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` (`build/`, `target/`, `dist/`) —
  it indexes cleanly and answers every question with nothing.
- **Generated / vendored code**: files that made it *into* the index and look
  machine-written — vendored directories, lockfiles, `*_pb2.py`, `*.pb.go`,
  `*.min.js`, and files whose first 2 KB carry `@generated`, `Code generated
  by` or `DO NOT EDIT`. Generated output is usually the largest and most
  repetitive text in a repository, so it dominates BM25 and crowds
  hand-written code out of a bounded pack. The remediation prints the
  `--exclude` globs to rebuild with.
- **Dense vector integrity**: checks `vectors.npy` and `vectors.meta.json`
  correspondence with `chunks.jsonl`.

**Agent wiring**

- **MCP SDK**: probes `mcp.server.Server` — the thing `serve()` needs — not
  just that `import mcp` succeeds.
- **MCP client configuration**: finds the Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor
  and Windsurf config files, and validates every repo2graph server entry in
  them — a `command` that is not on `PATH`, `uvx` without
  `--from "repo2graph[mcp]"`, a relative or non-existent repository path, and
  JSON that does not parse (a trailing comma here surfaces to the user only
  as "server failed to start"). It never reads or echoes an entry's `env`
  values.
- **LLM providers**: reports whether provider environment variables are set,
  never their values — no prefix, no tail, no length.

Every scan over an index is bounded, because `doctor` is the documented way
to inspect an index built somewhere else: `MAX_NODE_LINES`,
`MAX_FRESHNESS_FILES` and `MAX_GENERATED_CONTENT_SCANS` in
`repo2graph/doctor.py`. Exceeding one degrades the check to its cheap signal
and says so, rather than reading an attacker-chosen number of bytes.

Pass `--json` for machine-readable output suitable for CI or automation.
Exits `0` when every check passes or only warns, `1` when a check fails
outright — so `repo2graph doctor . --json` is safe to attach to a bug report
and safe to gate a pipeline on.

[The quickstart's troubleshooting table](quickstart.md#when-something-goes-wrong)
maps each symptom to the check that names it.

## `explain-path` — explain file inclusion or exclusion

```bash
repo2graph explain-path <path> [-r REPO] [-o OUT] [--include GLOB] [--exclude GLOB]
                         [--exclude-group NAME] [--include-vendor] [--include-secrets]
                         [--json]
```

Evaluates one path against the same rules `build`'s discovery uses, and reports
the single rule that decided it — not a trace of every rule that was checked.
`<path>` is relative to `-r`/`--repo` (default: the current directory) or
absolute; `--include`/`--exclude` are each repeatable, one glob per occurrence.
`-o`/`--out` (default `.r2g`, resolved exactly as `build`'s) names the output
directory a build would write to: discovery never indexes it, nor any directory
holding a repo2graph `agent/manifest.json` (an earlier build's index), and
`explain-path` reports those as `output_dir` / `index_dir` at step 2 — so
`explain-path .r2g/agent/nodes.jsonl` says EXCLUDED, as the build behaves. It
never opens the index. It also takes no size flags, so it cannot explain a build that used them: the size check
below is always evaluated against the 1.5 MB `--max-file-mb` default with
`--chunk-large-files` off, whatever the build was actually run with.

```bash
$ repo2graph explain-path repo2graph/cli.py
Path:            E:\Github\repo2graph\repo2graph\cli.py
Relative Path:   repo2graph/cli.py
Decision:        INCLUDED
Precedence Step: 10
Rule:            included
Reason:          Path passed all exclusion checks and is eligible for indexing

$ repo2graph explain-path .git/config
Path:            E:\Github\repo2graph\.git\config
Relative Path:   .git/config
Decision:        EXCLUDED
Precedence Step: 2
Rule:            skip_dir
Reason:          Path component '.git' is in excluded dot-directory filter (DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS/--exclude-dir)
```

`--json` returns the same facts as data: `path`, `relative_path`, `included`,
`rule`, `reason`, `precedence_step`.

### Precedence order

`explain_path` (`repo2graph/parse.py`) checks rules in this order and stops at
the first match:

| Step | Rule | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `outside_root` | The path resolves outside `-r`/`--repo`. |
| 1 | `not_found` | The path does not exist on disk. |
| 2 | `skip_dir` | A path component is a dot-directory, or is in `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` / `--exclude-dir` (`vendor/` only counts here when `--include-vendor` is off). |
| 3 | `internal_lock` | The path is a sibling `.*.r2glock` build-lock file. |
| 4 | `gitignore` | `.gitignore` excludes it, checked with `git check-ignore` — only when `-r` is a git checkout. |
| 5 | `non_regular_file` (or `stat_error`) | Not a regular file — a directory, symlink, device or FIFO — or `lstat` itself failed. |
| 6 | `too_large` | Bigger than `--max-file-mb` (default 1.5 MB) and `--chunk-large-files` is off. |
| 7 | `secret_file` | Matches a secret/credential path pattern and `--include-secrets` is off. |
| 8 | `not_included` | `--include` globs were given and the path matches none of them. |
| 9 | `exclude_glob` | The path matches an `--exclude` glob. |
| 10 | `binary` or `included` | A null byte in the first 4 KB marks it binary; otherwise every check passed. |

Step 10 covers both outcomes of the last check — `rule` (`binary` vs. `included`)
tells them apart, `precedence_step` is `10` either way.


## `explain` — graph and retrieval inspection

Explain connections, node properties, and retrieval decisions:

```bash
# Explain relationship between two nodes
repo2graph explain edge "file:src/main.py" "file:src/util.py" -o .r2g

# Inspect node metadata and incoming/outgoing edges
repo2graph explain node "sym:src/main.py::Runner.run" -o .r2g

# Trace retrieval ranking, candidate seeds, and graph expansion
repo2graph explain retrieval "how does authentication work" -o .r2g -k 8 --hops 1
```

All explain subcommands support `--json` for machine-readable output. `explain
retrieval` defaults to `-k 8`, the same as `rag` and `query`, so it traces the
retrieval they actually run; `--min-conf` is accepted as an alias of
`--min-confidence`. Like `rag` and `query`, `explain retrieval` leaves
secret-looking paths (`.env`, keys, credentials) out of the trace -- they are
neither listed as candidates, walked to, nor retrieved, and the text report
counts how many were hidden. `--include-secrets` opts back in;
`--secret-keyword KEYWORD` and `--secret-dir DIR` (repeatable) extend the rule.


## `impact` — PR & diff architectural impact analysis

```bash
repo2graph impact [repo] [-i <index_dir>] [--base <ref>] [--head <ref>] [--diff <file>] [--format <format>]
```

Computes the architectural blast radius of a working branch or PR against a base branch using the code graph. Intersects diff hunks with symbol spans, traverses reverse callers (`CALLS in`) and dependent modules (`IMPORTS in`), traces test coverage, and detects suspicious orphan changes or untested public APIs.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-i`, `-o`, `--index`, `--out <dir>` | `.r2g` | Built index directory containing `chunks.jsonl`, `nodes.jsonl`, `edges.jsonl`. |
| `repo` (positional) | current directory | Local repository path containing git history. |
| `--base <ref>` | `main` | Base git ref to compare against. If git fails and the repository has no `main`, the error ends with a hint to pass `--base`. |
| `--head <ref>` | working tree | Head git ref or commit to compare; omitted, the working tree (including uncommitted changes) is compared against `--base`. |
| `--diff <file>` | none | Path to raw unified diff file, or `-` for stdin (bypasses git). |
| `--format <format>` | `markdown` | Output format: `markdown`, `json`, `sarif`, `pr-comment`. |
| `--json` | off | Convenience shortcut for `--format json`. |
| `--sarif` | off | Convenience shortcut for `--format sarif`. |
| `--max-depth <n>` | `2` | Maximum caller traversal depth hops around changed symbols. |
| `--min-confidence <f>`, `--min-conf <f>` | none | Minimum edge confidence filter (`0.0` - `1.0`). |
| `--no-auto-build` | off | Fail instead of building the index when it is missing. |
| `--include-secrets` | off | Also report changes to secret-looking paths (`.env`, keys, credentials). Excluded by default, as in `rag`/`query` and MCP `repo_impact`. |
| `--write <path>` | none | Write output to target file path. |

## `completion` — shell tab completion

Prints shell completion configuration for `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`.
Tab completion relies on `argcomplete`, available via the `completion` extra:

```bash
pip install "repo2graph[completion]"
```

### Setup

**Bash:**
```bash
eval "$(repo2graph completion bash)"
# or: eval "$(register-python-argcomplete repo2graph)"
```

**Zsh:**
```zsh
autoload -U bashcompinit && bashcompinit
eval "$(repo2graph completion zsh)"
```

**Fish:**
```fish
repo2graph completion fish | source
```
