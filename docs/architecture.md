# Architecture

How repo2graph turns a source tree into a queryable graph, what that graph contains, and which
module owns which part of it.

Contributor setup, the test commands and the cross-platform invariants are in
[.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

```

Two required third-party packages (`tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-language-pack`). No graph library —
degree counting, force-directed layout and GraphML/Cypher generation are plain Python, on purpose.

**Data flows one way.** Parse knows nothing about graphs; graph knows nothing about chunks or
retrieval; retrieval knows nothing about the CLI or MCP. A change that reverses one of those arrows
is a bug in the change, not a missing feature.

The stages, in order:

1. **Discover** (`parse.discover`) — enumerate candidate files from `git ls-files`, falling back to
   a directory walk. Applies `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`, the size ceiling, and the exclusion layers below.
2. **Parse** (`parse.py`) — run the tree-sitter grammar for each file's language, extract symbol
   definitions and import statements.
3. **Build** (`graph.py`) — create nodes and edges, resolve call targets against the symbol table,
   resolve imports to in-repo files where possible, and read git history for `CO_CHANGE`.
4. **Chunk** (`chunks.py`) — cut source into retrieval units, one per symbol plus a file residual.
5. **Export** (`export.py`, `viz.py`) — write the `.r2g` artifacts and `graph.html`.
6. **Query** (`query.py`) — BM25 over chunks, RRF fusion, graph expansion, context packing.

## 2. Graph representation

### Node types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `repo` | the repository itself; one per index |
| `dir` | a directory |
| `file` | a source, doc or config file |
| `symbol` | a function, method, class, struct, trait, interface, type or module |
| `module` | an import target that is not a file in this repo |
| `external` | a call target that could not be resolved in this repo (stdlib or third-party) |

A symbol node's id is `sym:<path>::<qualname>`. When two definitions in one file share a qualname
(overloads, conditional definitions) the id gains an `@L<line>` suffix so it stays unique.

### Edge types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONTAINS` | repo -> dir -> file |
| `DEFINES` | file -> symbol, and symbol -> symbol nested inside it |
| `IMPORTS` | file -> file (`internal: true`) or file -> module |
| `CALLS` | symbol -> symbol in this repo; carries `count` and `confidence` |
| `CALLS_EXTERNAL` | symbol -> external, a name that resolved to nothing in-repo |
| `INHERITS` | symbol -> base class or interface |
| `CO_CHANGE` | file <-> file, edited together in 3+ of the commits read by `--git-history` |

### Edge metadata

Every edge goes through `Graph.add_edge()`, which normalises three fields:

- **`method`** — how the edge was derived (for example `same_file`, `import_resolved`,
  `receiver_typed`, `name_only`). It records the evidence class, not a quality score.
- **`confidence`** — a float on `CALLS` edges only, reflecting how much the resolution narrowed the
  candidate set. It deliberately does **not** encode "how likely is this call at runtime": a
  dynamically dispatched call that resolved to exactly one candidate scores high.
- **`evidence`** — the source line the reader is shown. Structural edges (`CONTAINS`) and
  historical ones (`CO_CHANGE`) legitimately carry `evidence: null`; never synthesise a line for a
  relation that has no syntactic site.

The confidence threshold gate applies to `CALLS` edges only. `DEFINES`, `IMPORTS` and `INHERITS`
carry no confidence and must not be dropped by a confidence filter.

### Artifacts

`export.py` owns the `.r2g` layout (`SECTIONS`, `path()`, `atomic_write`). An index directory holds
an `agent/` section for machine consumption and a `human/` section for reading:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `agent/nodes.jsonl` | one JSON object per node |
| `agent/edges.jsonl` | one JSON object per edge, with `method`/`confidence`/`evidence` |
| `agent/chunks.jsonl` | retrieval units with `start_line`/`end_line` and text |
| `agent/manifest.json` | index version, build config, counts, node/edge type descriptions |
| `agent/stats.json` | parse counts, language breakdown, ambiguous-call totals |
| `human/graph.html` | the self-contained force-directed view |
| `human/CHANGELOG.md` | the structural diff against the previous build |
| `local.json` | the absolute source root — machine-local, never published |

`local.json` sits outside `agent/` because it is the one file that must not travel with a published
index; the GitHub Action drops it from both the upload and the branch push.

---

## 3. Indexing behaviour

### Determinism

The discovery order dictates the emitted order of every record in `nodes.jsonl`, `edges.jsonl` and
`chunks.jsonl`. `parse.discover()` therefore sorts by `Path.as_posix()` rather than returning
filesystem order, and applies `DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS` identically on both the git-tracked and
directory-walk paths. Two builds of the same commit on different machines produce byte-identical
artifacts.

Each guarantee below is held by a named test, so a guarantee that stops being true fails the suite
rather than going quietly stale:

| Guarantee | Test |
|---|---|
| Two builds of one tree are byte-identical | `test_two_builds_of_one_tree_are_byte_identical` |
| Serial and parallel builds agree | `test_serial_and_parallel_builds_agree` |
| Filesystem enumeration order does not change the index | `test_filesystem_enumeration_order_does_not_change_the_index` |
| The git and walk discovery paths agree on the same tree | `test_git_and_walk_discovery_agree_on_the_same_tree` |
| An incremental rebuild equals a full one | `test_incremental_rebuild_equals_a_full_rebuild` |
| The sort key is POSIX, not filesystem order | `test_discovery_sort_key_is_posix` |
| Truncating at `--max-files` picks the same files every time | `test_max_files_truncation_is_deterministic` |
| Every exclusion glob matches its own representative paths | `test_every_exclusion_glob_matches_its_representative_paths` |
| A fresh clone, whose mtimes all moved, does not read as stale | `test_freshness_ignores_a_touched_but_unchanged_file` |
| A build does not index its own output directory | `test_freshness_does_not_count_the_index_as_added_source` |

### Provenance recorded in the manifest

`manifest.json` records where the index came from. Two top-level keys carry it:

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `source_revision` | an object describing the local checkout the build ran against (below) |
| `source_remote` | set instead of a local root when the build came from `repo2graph github` |

The fields inside `source_revision` are written by `integrity.get_source_provenance()`, and each is
present only when git could answer for it — a non-git tree gets an empty object, and a repository
with no diverged base branch gets no `merge_base`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `commit`, `short_commit` | the revision the build ran at |
| `branch` | the checked-out branch, omitted on a detached `HEAD` |
| `tag` | the tag pointing at this commit, when there is one |
| `dirty`, `dirty_files` | whether the tree had uncommitted edits, and how many files |
| `base_branch` | the branch the working tree was compared against |
| `merge_base` | the merge base between `HEAD` and `base_branch` |
| `commits_ahead_of_base` | how far `HEAD` had moved past `merge_base` |
| `remote_url` | the origin URL, with any credentials stripped |

`repo2graph index-status --json` reports the same facts but reshapes them into its own `source`
section rather than printing the manifest verbatim.

### What gets excluded, and by which layer

Four layers, applied in this order:

1. **`DEFAULT_SKIP_DIRS`** — `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, virtualenvs and the like, plus
   the index's own output directory. A build never indexes its own artifacts.
2. **Size and binary ceilings** — `MAX_BYTES` per file; files that do not decode as text are
   skipped and counted.
3. **Secret paths** (`security.py`) — credential-shaped paths are refused by default, and secret
   content inside files that *are* indexed is redacted. `--include-secrets` lifts the path
   exclusion only; content redaction stays on.
4. **Named exclusion groups** (`exclusions.py`) — `generated`, `vendor`, `build`, `dependencies`,
   `sensitive`, selected with `--exclude-group`. These are glob-shaped and independent of layer 3:
   `sensitive` is a second net for a tree that names its credentials something `security.py` does
   not recognise.

### Incremental rebuild

`build(cache=...)` reads a `{path: entry}` map from `agent/parse.cache.json` and reuses a file's
`ParsedFile` when its sha256 *and* its language both still match. Everything downstream of parsing
is then recomputed from the complete symbol set, exactly as a full build does: the global name
index, `CALLS` confidences, `INHERITS`, `mark_entrypoints()` and `reach`.

Nothing is spliced, and that is the whole design. `build()` resolves `CALLS` through a *global* name
index and sets `confidence = 1/len(candidates)`, so adding or deleting a symbol named `run` in file A
changes the confidence — and the count — of `CALLS` edges emitted from files B and C that did not
change at all; `mark_entrypoints()`/`reach` is a whole-graph BFS on top of that. A merge that
reparsed only the changed paths and spliced their nodes and edges in would produce an index that is
wrong in a way nothing detects: stale confidences and stale entrypoint flags flow straight into
`chunks.jsonl` headers and into `pack_context`'s `min_confidence` gate. Rebuilding every caller's
edges from its cached symbols is what makes a repo-wide confidence shift land correctly on an
unchanged caller.

The cost model is what makes exactness free rather than a compromise: parsing dominates a build and
resolution is O(edges) and negligible, so recomputing all of it buys correctness for no measurable
time. Every file is still *read* — the content hash is the bytes, and there is no cheaper way to know
a file is unchanged — and reading is the small half.

The acceptance test is whole-artifact byte equality against a full rebuild across an add, a modify,
a delete and a no-op (`tests/test_incremental.py`). That is also why the hit/miss tallies live on
`Graph.incremental` rather than in `Graph.stats`: `stats.json` is one of the artifacts compared, so a
counter that differs between the two routes by construction would have had to be special-cased out of
the comparison, weakening the very test that makes the feature trustworthy.

Deliberately not implemented: partial confidence recalculation over "affected symbol namespaces", and
a reverse-edge index for a partial reach BFS. Both compute the same answer as the full re-resolution
above, cost more code and more ways to be subtly wrong, and save time that is already close to zero.
If resolution ever becomes the bottleneck on a very large repo, that is when to revisit them, with a
profile in hand.

### Staleness

`status.compute_freshness()` is the single implementation of "is this index current", used by
`repo2graph index-status`. It compares the working tree against the manifest: mtime chooses which
files to hash, and the finding is always a hash mismatch — so a fresh clone, which rewrites every
mtime without changing a byte, does not read as stale. `doctor` deliberately has no freshness probe
of its own; two implementations of this answer drift until they contradict each other in front of a
user.

## 4. Language support

Seventeen languages get symbol-level treatment; every other file is still indexed as text.
Coverage is not uniform across them, and the differences are large enough that "supported"
on its own would mislead.

The scorecard below is computed from this project's own test corpus. **Only two of the seventeen
are additionally measured on third-party repositories** — Python and TypeScript, in
[`benchmarks/real/`](../benchmarks/real/README.md) — and the gap between those two kinds of
evidence is not small. Both parse defects found in the 2026-10 retrieval round
(class fields holding functions; export aliases having no node) sat in the single TypeScript
repository in that corpus, scored Tier 1 at 82 (B) here, and were invisible to the synthetic
suite. A high row below means "the patterns we thought to write a test for work", not "this
language has been exercised against real code".

<!-- END GENERATED: language-scorecard -->

Regenerate with `python scripts/generate_language_scorecard.py`;
`tests/test_doc_consistency.py::test_language_scorecard_matches_the_generator` fails if this
table and the generator disagree.

**What the numbers are, and are not.** Each dimension is scored by introspecting what the parser
actually declares for that language — the `LANG_CFG` entry's `kind_map`, `call_types`,
`import_types` and `doc` coverage, whether `_BASE_NODES` reaches its inheritance clause, whether
`parse_import_details` and `resolve_import` handle its module syntax, and whether the suite has
tests naming it. Two inputs are expert judgement rather than measurement: grammar robustness
(the macro penalty that holds C and C++ to 75) and ecosystem manifest awareness. Nothing in this
repository measures per-language `parse_errors` rates across real code, so those two columns are
the ones to distrust; `stats.json` reports `parse_errors` per build if you want to check a
language against your own tree. These are **capability** scores, not retrieval accuracy — they say what the
pipeline is equipped to extract, not how often an answer about that language is right. For
measured retrieval quality see [benchmarks/real/README.md](../benchmarks/real/README.md), which
covers Python and TypeScript only.

Two dimensions score low for every language because the feature does not exist yet rather than
because any one grammar is weak: repo2graph emits no `TESTS` edges (test-to-implementation
linking is inferred from `IMPORTS`), and no framework-specific edge types — no `ROUTES_TO`,
`INJECTS`, `MODELS` or `CONFIGURES`. Those two caps are why no language reaches an A overall.

**Priority order for deep support.** TypeScript/JavaScript and Python first: they are the two
ecosystems already at Tier 1, the two the retrieval benchmark measures, and the two where
framework-aware edges (routes, DI, ORM models) would pay off most. Go is the third, chosen over
Java/Kotlin because its import resolution already scores 100 while its call resolution is the
weakest part of an otherwise strong entry — the narrowest gap to close. C and C++ are explicitly
not on this list: the macro problem is upstream of anything repo2graph can fix without a
preprocessor.

## 5. Module reference

Sizes are a rough guide to where the complexity is, not a target.

### Core pipeline

| Module | Lines | Owns |
|---|---:|---|

| `viz.py` | 894 | `graph.html`: force-directed layout, the self-contained HTML template, escaping, and the `NODE_TYPES`/`EDGE_TYPES` descriptions `export.py` imports. |
| `chunks.py` | 397 | Cutting source into retrieval units; the `_lines()` helper every slicer must use. |

### Surfaces

| Module | Lines | Owns |
|---|---:|---|
| `cli.py` | 1,924 | Argument parsing and every subcommand. The widest module by fan-out. |
| `mcp/` | 2,387 | The MCP server, split by concern — see below. |
| `answer.py` | 609 | `rag --answer` only — the one network path in the package. |
| `explain.py` | 363 | `explain edge` / `node` / `retrieval`. |

### `mcp/` package

| Module | Lines | Owns |
|---|---:|---|
| `traversal.py` | 373 | `repo_path_between`, `repo_blast_radius`, and the doubly bounded graph walks behind them. |
| `schemas.py` | 374 | Tool annotations, titles, descriptions and JSON schemas. Declaration only. |
| `server.py` | 479 | Server lifecycle, stdio connection, SDK version gate. |
| `retrieval.py` | 367 | `repo_map`, `repo_search`, `repo_neighbours`, `repo_find_symbol`, `repo_read`. |
| `tools.py` | 286 | `dispatch()`, the cache and build-status tools, and the re-export surface. |
| `indexes.py` | 131 | Index open/reopen, per-directory locking, auto-build. |
| `guardrails.py` | 114 | Budget clamping, argument ceilings (`MCP_MAX_*`), path scrubbing. |
| `nodes.py` | 96 | Node labelling and staleness helpers both retrieval and traversal need. |

### Support

| Module | Lines | Owns |
|---|---:|---|
| `security.py` | 933 | Credential path classification (`_is_secret_path`), content scanning and redaction, event/URL/header sanitisation. A leaf. |
| `demo.py` | 669 | The bundled demo repository and its five starter questions. |
| `status.py` | 601 | `repo2graph index-status` and the shared freshness computation. |
| `integrity.py` | 575 | Output path hardening, artifact checksums, provenance, index verification (`valid` / `corrupt` / `stale` / `incompatible` / `partial`). |
| `bugreport.py` | 397 | The redacted diagnostic bundle. |
| `doctor.py` | 382 | Environment and artifact diagnostics. |

| `exclusions.py` | 311 | The named exclusion groups and their glob/reason tables. |
| `embed.py` | 307 | Vectors, and a stdlib-only `.npy` reader/writer. |
| `lock.py` | 299 | Build locking and stale-lock recovery. A leaf. |
| `audit.py` | 288 | Audit log sink. |
| `schema.py` | 273 | The record shapes the artifacts promise. |
| `tasks.py` | 263 | Background `--async-build` state. |
| `changelog.py` | 239 | The per-push structural graph diff in `human/CHANGELOG.md`. |
| `cache.py` | 223 | The MCP result cache. A leaf. |
| `events.py` | 160 | Structured event sink. |
| `edgemeta.py` | 158 | Edge citation formatting. |
| `limits.py` | 141 | Shared numeric ceilings. |

**If you add a module, make it a leaf.** `security.py`, `cache.py` and `lock.py` import nothing
from the package, which is why they are the easiest modules here to change safely.

### One import cycle you will meet

**`export.py` ↔ `viz.py`.** `export.py` does `from .viz import write_html` to emit `graph.html` as
one of its artifacts; only the `viz.py → export.py` direction is a cycle. The node and edge
descriptions therefore live once in `viz.py` (`NODE_TYPES`, `EDGE_TYPES`) and `export.py` imports
them alongside `write_html`. They used to be a hand-synced copy on each side, and the two had
already drifted.

## 6. Where a change goes

| You want to… | Start at | Also touch |
|---|---|---|
| Add a language | `parse.py` — `LANG_CFG`, `EXT_LANG` | A fixture, and the language list in the README (a test enforces this) |
| Change how a call resolves | `graph.py` — the scoped-resolution tiers | `tests/test_scoped_resolution.py`, `tests/test_resolution_heuristics.py` |
| Add an edge kind | `graph.py`, then `viz.py`'s `EDGE_TYPES` | The edge table above, and `query.py`'s `DEFAULT_EDGE_DIRS` if it should be traversable |
| Change retrieval | `query.py` — **`pack_context()`, not `retrieve()`** | `retrieve()` is a pinned back-compat surface; see the two-budget-models invariant in CONTRIBUTING |
| Add an MCP tool | `mcp/schemas.py`, then a handler in `retrieval.py` or `traversal.py`, then `dispatch()` | Clamp every numeric argument **in the handler**; `docs/mcp.md` (a test enforces the doc) |
| Add a CLI flag | `cli.py` | `docs/cli.md` and the README command table (both enforced by `tests/test_doc_consistency.py`) |
| Add an artifact | `export.py` — a writer plus a `SECTIONS` entry | `manifest.json`'s description map, and the artifact table above |
| Add an Action input | `action.yml` | `docs/cli.md`'s Action section (enforced); mind the shell/expression truthiness trap in CONTRIBUTING |

---

## 7. Tests

The files that will fail on a change you did not expect to be load-bearing:

| File | Guards |
|---|---|
| `test_doc_consistency.py` | Every CLI subcommand and every `LANG_CFG` grammar appears in the README and `docs/cli.md`; every Action input in `docs/cli.md`; every MCP tool in `docs/mcp.md`. |
| `test_compat.py` | Byte-identical `query`/`rag` output against a pinned baseline; the Action's input/output contract; the `action.yml` shell-vs-expression truthiness gate. |
| `test_determinism.py` | Discovery order, and that every exclusion glob matches its own representative paths. |
| `test_version_surfaces.py` | The version string in every surface that carries it, and that the bump script covers all of them. |
| `test_encoding.py` | The cp1252 / non-ASCII path class that has caused every historical regression here. |

Run the suite with `python -m pytest`. CI additionally runs `ruff check .`,
**`ruff format --check .`** and `mypy repo2graph` — the format check is a separate gate from the
lint check and is easy to miss locally.
