"""The version-bump surface table: that it is complete, and that a bump moves all of it.

The bug these encode: `bump_version.py` knew about `pyproject.toml`,
`server.json` and `repo2graph/__init__.py`, and `check_version.py` knew about the
same three. Nothing knew about the *documented* surfaces -- the `@vN` tag every
Action consumer is told to put in `uses:`, and the `repo2graph==X.Y.Z` pin
examples -- so after 2.0.0 shipped, the README still said `@v1` and described it
as following "every 1.x release", pointing users at a dead release line.

Per CONTRIBUTING.md, values here are hand-derived from the repo's own files, never
recomputed by the code under test: the expected version comes from
`pyproject.toml` read directly, and the things that must *not* move are literal
strings.
