"""The two places `graph.py` reads something too big to hold.

Both had the same shape of bug: a bound that was written down but not enforced
where it was promised. `_chunk_and_parse` sliced a large file at raw byte
offsets and threw away every slice that did not decode -- two of them per
straddling multi-byte character  -- while still buffering the whole
file for the digest. `add_cochange` capped `git log` output only after
`capture_output=True` had already read it to EOF .

Everything here is derived from the fixture bytes by hand: byte offsets counted
out in the test, sha256 taken with the stdlib, line counts from `count(b"\\n")`.
Nothing asserts a value the code under test produced.
