    That page states every number in it "came from an actual run recorded in
    ../benchmarks/results.json, never typed in by hand" -- but the table is
    hand-maintained (`generate_examples.py` writes `examples/<id>/README.md` and
    `results.json`, never the index page), so the claim rested on whoever last
    regenerated remembering to retype five rows. This is the check that was
    missing when all five examples were regenerated from 1.6.0 to 2.2.0.

    Deliberately *not* asserted here: that `repo2graph_version` in results.json
    equals the current package version. Regenerating needs network and clones of
    five large repositories, so that gate would turn red on every version bump
    and stay red until someone could run it -- and `results.json` is explicitly
    history, the version that *produced* an artifact rather than a claim about
    the current release (see `scripts/version_surfaces.py`, which excludes it
    from bumping for the same reason). Each example page records its own
    analyser version instead, which is what makes a stale figure visible.
