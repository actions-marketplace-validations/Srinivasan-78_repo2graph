"""Console output must never raise, whatever the platform decided stdout is.

Every historical regression in this project is a Windows encoding bug
(ISS-06/17/22/27), and they share a shape: code assumes stdout can represent
what it was handed. It usually can. Under a redirected Windows stdout it is a
cp1252 TextIOWrapper, and under Git Bash a *piped* one carries
`errors='surrogateescape'` -- which still raises on any character cp1252 lacks
that is not a lone surrogate, so the obvious "non-strict means safe" guard is
wrong.

The matrix below is the cross product that matters: encoding x error handler x
character. Each cell asserts the same two things -- no exception, and something
came out -- because a command that prints nothing is as broken as one that
crashes, just quieter.
