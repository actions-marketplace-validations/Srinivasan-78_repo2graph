"""Tests for the npx launcher at `npm/bin/repo2graph-mcp.js` (Issue #399).

Two layers, mirroring `tests/test_prod_igy.py`'s house style:

- Static assertions over the source text, which run everywhere with no Node.js
  in the pytest environment.
- A behavioural layer that runs the real script under `node`, skipped when
  `node` is not on PATH. The GitHub-hosted runners this project's CI matrix
  uses all ship Node, so this layer does run in CI on all three platforms.

The behavioural layer is the detector for the bug it was written for: Node
>= 18.20 / 20.12 refuses to spawn a `.cmd`/`.bat` without `shell: true` and
fails with EINVAL (the CVE-2024-27980 fix). The launcher's PATH walk accepts
`.CMD`/`.BAT` from PATHEXT, so a batch shim on PATH -- how chocolatey and
several version managers install `uvx`/`pipx` -- was detected and then failed
to launch.

    no backslash escape for an embedded `"` -- `\\"` is a C-runtime convention,
    not a cmd.exe one, so the `"`-escaping in `quoteForCmd` is a no-op there.
    Rather than hand cmd.exe a line it will mangle, `run()` refuses.

    Deliberately asserts opposite outcomes per platform, because the gate is
    reached only via `needsShell`, which is `win32 && (.cmd|.bat)`:

    - Windows: the shim `_write_uvx_shim` lays down is a `.cmd`, so the gate
      fires -- exit 1, and the argument never reaches the shim.
    - POSIX: the shim is an extensionless `uvx` spawned with no shell at all, so
      the same argument is passed through to argv untouched. That is the real
      assertion here, not merely `returncode == 0`: no shell means no mangling.

    Uses `_write_uvx_shim` rather than writing a `uvx.cmd` on both platforms --
    `resolveCommand` consults PATHEXT only on Windows (`exts = [""]` elsewhere),
    so a POSIX `uvx.cmd` is invisible to the PATH walk and the launcher would
    fall through to the "no working Python launcher" branch and exit 1, making a
    `returncode == 0` assertion fail on two of the three CI legs.
