"""Backlog E40: `--max-edges`, `--max-bytes` and `--limit-policy`.

`--max-files` already bounded discovery, but nothing bounded the two axes that
actually decide a build's memory ceiling on a large repository: total source
bytes read, and total edges held. A repository can sit well under any file count
and still produce millions of edges, because edges grow with the square of how
interconnected the code is, not with how many files it has.

The property these tests care about most is not that a limit truncates -- that
part is easy -- but that a truncated index *says so*. `limits_hit` is written to
`stats.json` under both policies, because the question a reader cannot otherwise
answer is "are there really no callers of `f`, or was that edge dropped at the
ceiling?". `truncate` suppresses the stderr line, never the record.
