"""#241: the provider response must be read under a byte ceiling, on both axes.

`stream_answer` used to iterate the response directly (`for raw in resp`) and
accumulate every decoded delta for the life of the call. That is two unbounded
reads, not one: a body with no newline in it is buffered whole by the line
iterator before any repo2graph code sees a byte, and a body that *is* newline
framed is still accumulated without limit. `HTTP_TIMEOUT` bounds neither -- it
is a socket timeout, so a host trickling bytes resets it forever.

The tests below pin both axes against the real `MAX_ANSWER_BYTES`, not against a
shrunken one, so a fixture that is simply smaller than the ceiling cannot pass
them by accident. Every expected value is hand-written here; none is computed by
calling the code under test.
