"""Property-based tests for the three places hand-written examples kept missing.

Every test in this file is here because an enumerated example suite had already
been written for the same code and still let a bug through. The pattern is
always the same: the example picks the separator, the offset or the character
the author happened to think of, and the bug lives one character to the left.
Hypothesis picks them all.

Three areas, each with its own history in this repository:

* **UTF-8 and surrogates.** `tests/test_encoding.py` enumerates a 5x7x5 matrix
  of encoding x error handler x character on the *output* side. Nothing covered
  the *input* side -- arbitrary bytes off disk, sliced at arbitrary offsets by
  `graph._chunk_and_parse`, decoded and then counted for line numbers.
* **Chunk line slicing.** `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` invariant 1 forbids
  `splitlines()` because it breaks on U+2028/U+2029/U+0085/\\x0b/\\x0c, which
  tree-sitter's `Point.row` does not. An example only detects that if the author
  thought to put one of those five characters in the fixture.
* **Path normalization.** Separators, `..`, case and unicode. The verdicts here
  are security boundaries (a `.env` that dodges `_is_secret_path` gets indexed),
  and a boundary tested only on the spellings someone imagined is a boundary
  with unknown holes.

**Determinism.** The profile below is `derandomize=True`: Hypothesis derives its
inputs from a hash of the test rather than from entropy, so a green run here is
green on every machine and every rerun, and a failure is reproducible without a
`.hypothesis` database. `max_examples=100` keeps the whole file well under a
second of a ~3-minute suite; `deadline=None` because a cold first example on a
loaded CI runner is not a performance regression.
